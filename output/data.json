As on his debut disc, BRUSHFIRE FAIRYTALES, Johnson serves up a groovy, yet slightly melancholy stew in his trademark breathy voice, which at its best recalls everyone from Steve Miller to Chet Baker to Evan Dando of The Lemonheads. This time around, however, the vocalist/guitarist isn't afraid to gently stir pinches of reggae, hip-hop, and Harry Belafonte style pop-calypso into his usual hippie jam-band roux. Mario Caldato Jr.'s ultra-sparse, live-sounding production carefully reveals the subtle sadness that lurks behind even Johnson's poppiest tunes, making ON AND ON the perfect album for a midnight beach party on the last night of summer vacation.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HY-FNFKAL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "ElectricBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Times Like These"}, {"Track 2": "Horizon Has Been Defeated"}, {"Track 3": "Traffic in the Sky"}, {"Track 4": "Taylor"}, {"Track 5": "Gone"}, {"Track 6": "Cupid"}, {"Track 7": "Wasting Time"}, {"Track 8": "Holes to Heaven"}, {"Track 9": "Dreams Be Dreams"}, {"Track 10": "Tomorrow Morning"}, {"Track 11": "Fall Line"}, {"Track 12": "Cookie Jar"}, {"Track 13": "Rodeo Clowns"}, {"Track 14": "Cocoon"}, {"Track 15": "Mediocre Bad Guys"}, {"Track 16": "Symbol in My Driveway"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.32 x 12.36 x 0.31 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Republic Records", "model_number": "28930141", "release_date": "2003", "availability": "December 15, 2006", "label": "Republic Records", "asin": "B000092PT7", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": ""}

{"id": "EttaJames_TellMama", "album_title": "\"Tell Mama\"", "artist": "\"Etta James\"", "description": "\"Down in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Atlantic Records' Jerry Wexler had fallen out with Rick Hall at FAME studio after an Aretha Franklin session ended with Aretha storming back to New York. Wexler later set up the Muscle Shoals session guys in their own studio, Muscle Shoals Sound. Furious at the betrayal, Hall went to see Atlantic's arch-rival, Chess Records, and persuaded Leonard Chess to bring his top Soul acts to FAME. Between August and December 1967, Chess's Etta James, recorded her greatest album, TELL MAMA, at FAME. Etta's career had faltered, and it took the Muscle Shoals sessions to bring her back. The LP's title song, Tell Mama, as well as Otis Redding's Security became Top 40 hits and Top 20 R&B hits for Etta. It was the B-side of Tell Mama that would become the LP's enduring track, though. I'd Rather Go Blind was written by Etta's friend, Fugi Foster, who handed it to her when she went to see him in prison. Although never a charted hit for Etta, this is the original version of a song that has been recorded hundreds of times by artists as diverse as Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Paolo Nutini, Mick Hucknall, and the Allman Brothers. Recognized today as one of the greatest Soul LPs of all time, TELL MAMA hasn't been available on vinyl for more than forty years.

{"id": "CocteauTwins_MilkKisses", "album_title": "\"Milk & Kisses\"", "artist": "\"Cocteau Twins\"", "description": "\"Released in March 1996, Milk & Kisses is the eighth and final studio album by Cocteau Twins. And like its predecessor, 1993\\u2019s Four Calendar Caf\\u00e9, it\\u2019s yet to be formally released on vinyl outside Europe. That all changes next January when 4AD will reissue both titles in the United States. The second of two albums Cocteau Twins released via Fontana / Capitol Records after their long association with 4AD ended in 1990 with Heaven or Las Vegas, the band warmed the waters for Milk & Kisses with a pair of exceptional EPs where they took their music to new places, Twinlights and Otherness - the first largely acoustic, the second their only sanctioned remixes (done with Seefeel\\u2019s Mark Clifford). A period of high creativity for the band, renewed after a turbulent time, they recorded and produced Milk & Kisses between their September Sound studio in London and the coastal town of Pors Poulhan in Brittany, France. Featuring the singles \\u2018Tishbite\\u2019 and \\u2018Violaine\\u2019 and fan favourites such as \\u2018Serpentskirt\\u2019 and \\u2018Treasure Hiding\\u2019, the album is a cathartic listen too with MOJO saying in a glowing review that the album\\u2019s title \\u201caccurately intimates its soothing, healing powers.\\u201d Ultimately, Milk & Kisses also proved to be their swan song, bringing the curtain down on 14 years of wonder to leave an incredible legacy that new generations continue to discover to this day. 4AD are delighted to announce that they\\u2019re working with the band on reissuing both Four Calendar Caf\\u00e9 and Milk & Kisses in the United States, with CD and black vinyl editions of both titles coming out on January 12th 2024. To do this, Robin Guthrie returned to his original studio mixes and has delivered stunning, brand new 24-bit masters of both titles. A1. Violaine A2. Serpentskirt A3. Tishbite A4. Half-Gifts A5.

{"id": "BobbyBlueBland_Dreamer", "album_title": "\"Dreamer\"", "artist": "\"Bobby \\\"Blue\\\" Bland\"", "description": "\"Bobby 'Blue' Bland (1930 - 2013) was one of the leading US-American Blues, R&B and Soul entertainers. He knew how to combine the intensity of Gospel music with the expression of the Blues. His voice sounded as he wanted to bear witness to one's resolve but he was able to let his voice sound soft, sometimes cool but always cultivated. Thus he also reached out to the fans of Frank Sinatra and Nat 'King' Cole with tremendous success. He formed his remarkable style of singing out of many different influences, characteristic and exclusively reserved for Bobby 'Blue' Bland. Blands voice was always the center of attention. After his huge successes during the 1950s and 1960s for the Duke label, he moved to ABC Dunhill when Duke was sold. He could reach a wider white audience in the early 1970s with his two LPs, 'His California Album' and 'Dreamer', plus productions together with B.B. King. 'Dreamer' was the record company's trial to produce an album in California with the cool Soul appeal of the city of Los Angeles. As a timeless Soul and Blues classic the album contains the in recent years often sampled track Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City, one of the musical back bones to one of the favorites by Jay Z. The whole album is a wonderful soundtrack for those lonely nights alone and blue in a sleazy joint trying to forget a lost love in a bottle of bourbon. 'Dreamer' is the warm velvet cover against cold loneliness with so many great songs like I Wouldn't Treat A Dog (The Way You Treated Me) and Whose Foolin' Who?, the bluesy Cold Day In Hell, Lovin' On Borrowed Time and When You Come To The End Of Your Road. I Ain't Gonna Be The First To Cry has indeed the lyrical quality of The Thrill Is Gone. The production by Steve Barri and Michael Omartian sounds full and ponderous. The accompanying musicians, amongst them guitarists Dean Parks and Larry Carlton, bassist Wilton Felder and drummer Ed Green, belong to the cream of L.A.'s studio musicians.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BRpnHGg8L._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "ContemporaryBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City 3:51"}, {"Track 2": "I Wouldn't Treat a Dog (The Way You Treated Me) 3:15"}, {"Track 3": "Lovin' on Borrowed Time 3:19"}, {"Track 4": "The End of the Road 3:06"}, {"Track 5": "I Ain't Gonna Be the First to Cry 3:36"}]}, {"Disc 2": [{"Track 1": "Dreamer 4:09"}, {"Track 2": "Yolanda 3:43"}, {"Track 3": "Twenty-Four Hour Blues 3:59"}, {"Track 4": "Cold Day in Hell 2:43"}, {"Track 5": "Who's Foolin' Who 4:18"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "0.38 x 12.44 x 12.3 inches; 12 ounces", "manufacturer": "Bear Family", "model_number": "BAF18029", "release_date": "2017", "availability": "April 18, 2017", "label": "Bear Family", "asin": "B06Y3PSCDN", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": "33 minutes"}

Vaughan may have been the new news at the time, but King was not suffering either--he had a world-class supporting band and was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and that's exactly what they delivered. Vaughan was clearly influenced by King--there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence that stayed with him to the end--and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol. King must have been impressed, since IN SESSION never devolves into a mere cutting contest.

The kind of band whose members are fully immersed in their local scene-through a handful of notable side projects and the show-promoting Philly staple 4333 Collective-the quintet\\u2019s sound takes wide-spectrum influence from its environment. The result is an amalgam of complex song structures and flourishes of technical acumen, wholly unconcerned with genre, yet evoking the specific styles of touchstones such as Paramore and Circa Survive. On their debut longplayer Where the Heart Is, Sweet Pill\\u2019s unbound, raucous energy presents through ten autobiographical tracks that hinge on singer Zayna Youssef\\u2019s elastic, enrapturing voice-at times belting and controlled, at others textural and guttural. Supporting Youssef are guitarists Jayce Williams and Sean McCall, bassist Ryan Cullen, and drummer Chris Kearney. Their blistering lead single \\u201cBlood\\u201d sees Youssef exploring a deteriorated friendship over Williams and McCall\\u2019s trudging riffs and tactful counterpoint, with Cullen and Kearney rumbling nimbly in the song\\u2019s foundations. Second single \\u201cHigh Hopes\\u201d counters with introspective, melodic punk that reshapes anxiety rather than succumb to it. But third single \\u201cDiamond Eyes\\u201d momentarily slows the pace, with McCall joining Youssef on vocals for a breakup lament laden with acoustic sentimentalism and an emotive flurry from guest flutist Jill Ryan. Such range is the central facet of Where the Heart Is, where Sweet Pill\\u2019s penchant for combining punkish tropes enlivened with the vibrance of math-rock and the aggression of post-hardcore sweetened with pop sensibility compound into something stylistically new yet still familiar. 1.

Originally put to tape in \\u201882 & \\u201883 for the Clean Cuts label, these tracks have remained unheard until now. Two numbers feature the doc's raspy growl while his solo piano navigates us through the rest of the train ride, past touches of blues, jazz, and foot stompin\\u2019 boogie-woogie jive. It's the kind of magic that can only come from a dusty tape box. In 1981, Dr. John began recording his first of two solo piano albums. The \\u201cnew\\u201d performances featured on this release are of the same quality as the music on Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack and The Brightest Smile In Town. His left hand creates a three-note rhythmic pattern that forms the foundation for the performance while his right soulfully plays the melody and then builds off of it in the tradition of the New Orleans piano blues masters. In other songs, it begins as a nostalgic and heartfelt ballad, picking up steam during the performance and switching moods several times before returning to where it began. While it is a real shame that he would never again record a full album of unaccompanied solos (Dr. John enjoyed leading a band too much), the release of Frankie & Johnny gives one an additional opportunity to discover just how brilliant and spirited a pianist Mac Rebennack was during his colorful career.

{"id": "SamanthaFish_RunawayRed", "album_title": "\"Runaway - Red\"", "artist": "\"Samantha Fish\"", "description": "\"SAMANTHA FISH IS NOW A MAJOR ACT... Red Vinyl. \\\"First time available on vinyl. Red vinyl pressing.\\\". Just a few months ago, very few people outside Kansas City, Missouri knew there was a young, dynamic musician named Samantha Fish getting ready to take the world by storm. In fact, it's not all that long ago that the 22-year-old singer/guitarist first discovered the blues and started paying her dues on that city's local scene. With Runaway, her solo debut, she now breaks out big time, announcing herself as a newcomer to be reckoned with. The album's nine original songs and pair of covers incorporate \\\"all the sounds I grew up with, with my own spin,\\\" says Fish, who seems to have spent her formative years in the Midwest soaking up a vast array of musical styles. Runaway features sharp-edged, riff-driven blues (\\\"Down in the Swamp\\\"), breakneck boogies (\\\"Runaway\\\"), smoky, late-night jazz (\\\"Feeling Alright\\\") as well as hints of the sultry 70s hard rock of Ann and Nancy Wilson and the 4/4 ruggedness of the Rolling Stones. Throughout, Fish demonstrates astonishing range and depth as a songwriter. Her vocals are cool, confident and nothing less than beguiling. Backing her on this eclectic collection of modern electric blues is the same crack team that first convened for the making of Girls With Guitars. That collaboration with fellow female artists Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde, released earlier this year, already showed that Fish refuses to be intimidated, even when working with musicians more experienced than herself. \\\"They are incredibly talented and creative, so it made for fun sessions,\\\" she says of the well-oiled studio band heard on Runaway. Jamie Little, one of the UK's most in-demand drummers, reunites with bassist Cassie Taylor to give the record plenty of rhythmic thump. Producer Mike Zito, a St. Louis native and 2010 Blues Music Award winner, adds thick, meaty electric guitar on most cuts. \\\"Mike and I have known each other for a few years now, so he knew the sound and style I was after. He did a great job of taking ideas and giving them direction in the studio setting.\\\"In between making these first two albums, Fish spent a month on the road with Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde for the first leg of the year-long Blues Caravan Tour. It gave her the valuable opportunity to road-test the material heard on Runaway to a discriminating audience. With an exciting new debut album now in her back pocket, the tour continues throughout the summer and into the fall of 2011, touching down at many European and North American festivals and even taking to the seas on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise in October.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VF73KJZsL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Down in the Swamp"}, {"Track 2": "Runaway"}, {"Track 3": "Today's My Day"}, {"Track 4": "Money to Burn"}, {"Track 5": "Leavin' Kind"}, {"Track 6": "Otherside of the Bootle"}, {"Track 7": "Soft and Slow"}, {"Track 8": "Push Comes to Shove"}, {"Track 9": "Louisiana Rain"}, {"Track 10": "Feelin' Alright"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "", "manufacturer": "Ruf", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2025", "availability": "October 30, 2024", "label": "Ruf", "asin": "B0DLDWBMJN", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

{"id": "OtisSpann_WalkingTheBlues", "album_title": "\"Walking The Blues\"", "artist": "\"Otis Spann\"", "description": "\"Perhaps best known for his long association with the legendary Muddy Waters, Otis Spann is largely recognized as one of the greatest blues pianists of all time, if not the greatest. Although Spann made a name for himself in Chicago by the mid 1940s, it wasn\\u2019t until 1960 that he got the opportunity to record an album of his own. The sessions Spann did with Candid Records co-founder Nat Hentoff that year resulted in the legendary album Otis Spann Is The Blues. (Incidentally, this was also the first album ever recorded for the fledgling New York City based label.) The tracks on Walking The Blues were recorded during those same sessions in August of 1960 in New York City. Left on the cutting room floor, they would not be officially released until 1972, two years after Spann\\u2019s untimely death. Robert Lockwood Jr., also from Muddy Water\\u2019s group, accompanies Spann on guitar here as he does on the Is The Blues album. But Walking The Blues also features Spann\\u2019s close friend, veteran singer and composer James Oden, better known to blues fans as St. Louis Jimmy. Stripped down to just the these musicians, this magnificently performed and produced set showcases Spann\\u2019s voice as well as piano. Spann stretches out with his pulsing two-handed rhythmic attack, and brings the barrelhouse piano style of his youth in line with the modern Chicago style he embodied. A1.

In segregated neighborhoods, community members gathered in saloons,dancehalls, and each other's homes to hear their neighbors sing their stories of sorrow, heartbreak,jubilation, and triumph. Robert \\\"Mack\\\" McCormick, an academically untrained but fanatical devotee ofthe blues, stepped into this world and became one of it's most devout advocates and documentarians.By photographing Black and Latino Texans and their neighborhoods, as well as recording andinterviewing musicians-many of whom never stepped foot into a proper recording studio-McCormickendeared and eventually embedded himself into these communities. By the time he died in 2015,McCormick had amassed a collection of 590 reels of sound recordings and 165 boxes of manuscripts,original interviews and research notes, thousands of photographs and negatives, playbills, and posters.Because McCormick never published or released most of these materials, his collection became a thingof legend and intense speculation among scholars, blues aficionados, and musicians alike.Playing for the Man at the Door: Field Recordings from the Collection of Mack McCormick, 1958-1971 isthe first compilation of music drawn from this fabled collection, which indelibly documents a pivotalmoment in African American history. It features never-before-heard performances not only frommusicians who became icons in their own right-including Lightnin' Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb-butalso, crucially, performers whose names may be unfamiliar to even the most devoted blues fans andscholars. Newly mastered recordings and accompanying photographs bring to life many of theseforgotten figures: offering insight into their lives and illuminating in new, enlightening ways their joysand anguish, deep social connections, distinctive voices, and cultural networks. The collection spansgospels, ragtime, country blues dirges, the unclassifiable music of George \\\"Bongo Joe\\\" Coleman, andmore, showing that no community, no matter how tight knit, is monolithic.Accompanying the music is a 128-page book, which contains breathtaking photographs by McCormickand his associates, as well as contextual essays by producers Jeff Place and John Troutman onMcCormick's life, and by musicians Mark Puryear and Dom Flemons on some of the marginalizedcommunities throughout \\\"Greater Texas\\\" to which McCormick devoted his life's work.

{"id": "JuniorWells_HoodooManBlues", "album_title": "\"Hoodoo Man Blues\"", "artist": "\"Junior Wells\"", "description": "\"Product Description   Vinyl LP reissue. One of the truly classic blues albums of the 1960s, and one of the first to successfully capture the smoky ambience of a night at a West Side nightspot. The Monday blues boys-guitarist Buddy Guy, bassist Jack Myers, drummer Billy Warren-join Wells on his harp to create this raw, gutsy, uninhibited sound, yielding melodic memory-makers such as \\\"Snatch it Back and Hold it,\\\" \\\"You Don't Love Me, Baby,\\\" \\\"Chitlin con Carne,\\\" and others. Widely hailed as one of Wells's finest achievements, the album has gone on to be Delmark's highest-selling release of all time. And little wonder why: If not just Wells, Guy truly dazzles here on the guitar. Every blues lover will confirm this record as prerequisite stuff for Chicago Blues 101.   Review   Originally released in 1965, this is one of the great blues albums of all time, featuring as it does, some of the greats of the genre such as Buddy Guy on guitar, Jack Myers on bass and Billy Warren on drums.The original recording is beautifully mixed because it sounds so authentic. It's as if the studio has been moved to a small, local venue somewhere in the middle of a field filled with carousing people full of liquor and bad language.If you have no experience of the blues and are looking for an entry point or, if you're a blues fan and have yet to come across this stone-cold classic, then grab this release as soon as you can but do it using this vinyl version. This is the format it was recorded for and this is the format that best conveys the atmosphere and energy of the performers. -- Hi-Fi World UK, May 2010\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fLdB73dtL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "RegionalBlues", "ChicagoBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Snatch It Back and Hold It"}, {"Track 2": "Ships on the Ocean"}, {"Track 3": "Good Morning Schoolgirl"}, {"Track 4": "Hound Dog"}, {"Track 5": "In the Wee Hours"}, {"Track 6": "Hey Lawdy Mama"}]}, {"Disc 2": [{"Track 1": "Hoodoo Man Blues"}, {"Track 2": "Early in the Morning"}, {"Track 3": "We're Ready"}, {"Track 4": "You Don't Love Me, Baby"}, {"Track 5": "Chitlin Con Carne"}, {"Track 6": "Yonder Wall"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.32 x 12.36 x 0.31 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Delmark", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2002", "availability": "December 18, 2006", "label": "Delmark", "asin": "B00007JGQI", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": ""}

A bold, brave and courageous leap forward from her critically acclaimed debut album Lost and Found - falling or flying is an album that speaks to the musical and emotional era where Jorja is now, and how she got here. Sonically, this album, a no-skips body of work, isn't like anything you've heard before. It sits masterfully in this same space of excitement, self-exploration and self-assertion that Jorja does. Compromised of deep, thumping drums, racing basslines, irresistible hooks and distinctive beats, falling or flying runs at the same pace that Jorja's mind does. 'I don't slow down enough' she says. 'This album is like my brain. There's always so much going on but each song is definitely a standstill moment.' Much of the creative energy that shaped the album emerged from studio sessions with the producer duo DAMEDAME* back in her hometown of Walsall, where, to Jorja, the heart is.

Shot before the turn of the century, the photographs resonate with music. The images inspired an accompanying soundtrack. The music is full of stories. The songs and stories originate in two neighboring rural counties. The cast of characters includes four families of Mississippi musicians, three generations deep, and a photographer from Texas.\\u201d - Luther Dickinson In 2017, Wyatt McSpadden found an old roll of film and tracked down members of North Mississippi Allstars to share his forgotten photographs. The images were so profound and so beautiful that they would come to inspire the latest recording, Up And Rolling. The images inspired the band to ask, \\u201cWhat did the music sound like that night in 96? What does Mississippi music sound like now? What would ideally be on the push button AM/FM radio as we drove thru the hills?\\u201d The North Mississippi Allstars would return to the famous Zebra Ranch to record Up And Rolling, inspired by Wyatt\\u2019s images. They gathered together, trimmed back the wisteria, and swept out the converted barn recording studio. The fired up the tube amps and old computers and began conjuring up modern Mississippi music, ancient and futuristic all at once. Telling it how it was and how they think it should be. Up And Rolling is modern Mississippi. Transcending time and space, the music reaches out into the dark of night like the wisteria vine, looking for free hearted souls to latch onto and wedge into the foundation of hate, slowly tearing down walls a generation at a time.

The result of a dark night of the soul\\u2014and ensuing epiphany\\u2014that led to a series of professional and personal reckonings, Sweet Justice isn\\u2019t a revenge album, but it does stem from a profound sense of karma.

After severing ties with old friends, she found some new ones on the same creative wavelength: Canadian producers Stint and Kaytranada, and fellow Australian Flume, all of whom contribute production. Sweet Justice is an album that embodies the beautiful contradictions of Tkay\\u2019s art: it\\u2019s a coming-of-age record by someone who\\u2019s mastered the game; an album about karmic justice and accountability that\\u2019s bright, breezy and incredibly fun, eviscerating those who are dishonest and disrespectful with a venom-laced kiss.

The LP it's a superb collection of King's early hits, originally released on the RPM label. In five short years, B.B. King had matured from an artist looking for a style to the premier bluesman of his generation. His modern style that crosses rock & roll and R&B with the jump blues is fully developed here, and his consistency from track to track is remarkable. On Please Love Me, King combines T-Bone Walker's hard-picking, distorted guitar style with his own mournful singing. The arrangements are smooth and elegant, frequently displaying a hint of jazz, and King is backed by a well-arranged horn section in true Memphis blues fashion. This blues-meets-urban-soul style masterpiece has been packaged in this very special release, which also includes 2 bonus tracks from the same period. Contained here is the cream of the crop from B.B. King's hit-making stretch for Crown Records during his most inspired years. Without a doubt, this is the material upon which B.B.'s kingdom was built.

{"id": "DevonAllman_RaggedDirtyBlue", "album_title": "\"Ragged & Dirty - Blue\"", "artist": "\"Devon Allman\"", "description": "\"For Ragged & Dirty, Devon left his Southern comfort zone, hired a crack Chicago band, and enlisted the producing and writing talents of Grammy winning producer Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, George Thorogood, Johnny Winter, James Cotton, Joe Louis Walker). Though Hambridge wrote four tunes and Devon picked three to cover, it s his original tunes that speak to his artistic journey. To hear how a groove takes over, check out the spontaneity of his Midnight Lake Michigan. Devon s dark and ominous guitar howls push the nine-minute instrumental with a hoodoo aura. As the tension builds, the song adds Marty Sammon s keyboards and Tom Hambridge s percussion in a swirl of primal rhythms. To hear Devon s vocal range, listen to this audiophile 180 gram pressing closer, Leave The City. With only Hambridge keepin the sparse beat, Devon strips down and shows off his pleading, Allman-esque voice and stirring resonator guitar in this move to country blues simplicity. Luther Allison s Ragged & Dirty is a funk meets blues that provides Devon s hot-shot Chicago studio band of bassist Felton Crews (Charlie Musselwhite and others), guitarist Giles Corey (Billy Branch), and keyboard ace Marty Sammon (Buddy Guy) along with Nashville s Hambridge on drums room to show-off. Allman s Leavin  provides the band the opportunity to play with a subdued delicacy, while Back To You builds from Devon s expressive solo over Sammon s B-3 foundation into a blistering slow blues ballad. There s an expressive side to Devon as he and Wendy Moten handle the Spinner s classy I ll Be Around. And Devon s cover of Otis Taylor s haunting Ten Million Slaves commands our attention to bear witness to our historic injustices.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814TqaumQbL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "ContemporaryBlues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.22 x 12.23 x 12.23 inches; 14.24 ounces", "manufacturer": "Ruf", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2014", "availability": "November 4, 2014", "label": "Ruf", "asin": "B00NPD0SZ6", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Charters bailed the guitar out of hock and bought the bluesman a bottle of gin. The pair then proceeded to Hopkins' dingy hotel room to record the album that revitalized Hopkins' career, establishing the Texas bluesman as a darling of the 60's folk circuit. In retrospect, it's easy to see how Hopkins caught on with '60s folk audiences. He had the pedigree-as a child, he led Blind Lemon Jefferson around the streets of Houston. Hopkins had a complex personality. As a singer, the bluesman manages to project charm and orneriness simultaneously. His fluid guitar style is both exquisitely musical and technically impressive, while his facility for improvising lyrics undoubtedly delighted many audiences. For both it's historical significance and the quality of the music it contains, LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS is a necessity for any serious blues fan.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LDbswDGFL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "", "dimensions": "12 x 12.6 x 1 inches; 8 ounces", "manufacturer": "Vinyl Lovers", "model_number": "WA-31970167", "release_date": "2017", "availability": "January 19, 2017", "label": "Vinyl Lovers", "asin": "B01N5QV4R7", "country_origin": "Spain", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": ""}

Working with producer Dennis Herring (Counting Crows, Jars of Clay) and a small collective of Mississippi-based musicians, Guy sings with a passion that can only come from the same source as the songs.The noise generated in the studio through vintage amplifiers has a live and dangerous feel to it. The acoustic opener, \\\"Done Got Old,\\\" does not prepare the listener for the colossal aural assault of \\\"Baby, Please Don't Leave Me.\\\" Fading in on a percussion track, Guy's guitar hits its cat-strangling best and never looks back, while the voice sounds energized, vital, and wholly contemporary. Through the 12-minute \\\"I Got to Try It, Girl\\\" to the closing Guy composition \\\"It's a Jungle Out There,\\\" Sweet Tea has all the hallmarks of a classic blues album, mixed with a twist of the new.Grammy nominated Sweet Tea is now finally available on vinyl for the first time.

He was a brilliant creative musician who managed a stunningly effective fusion of his Delta roots and the smoother approach of the then prominent contemporary blues artists. As with any genius in any field he was able to produce great work only because he was standing on the shoulders of previous great artists.

What do you do after being in the Libertines, one of the most notorious British bands of the early 21st Century? For Carl Bart, you form Dirty Pretty Things, something of an indie supergroup of their moment. Joining Bart was Libertines drummer Gary Powell, guitarist Anthony Rossomando, who'd stood in for Doherty, and former Cooper Temple Clause bassist, Didz Hammond. Leading Waterloo To Anywhere was the infectious UK Top 5 hit Bang Bang You're Dead, which set the tone for the fabulous collection of rock, punk and ska. Recorded in Los Angeles with producer Dave Sardy and then later in Glasgow with Tony Doogan, the album showed the strength of the group's writing. Away from the standard high-octane indie of Gin & Milk and You F*cking Love It, The Gentry Cove was particularly captivating, marrying Bart's fascinating wordplay with robust Clash reggae/sea shanty interludes. Two years later, it was all over; Bart and Powell rejoined the Libertines (and Rossomando later going on to win an Oscar for co-writing Shallow from the film A Star Is Born).\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FjoFYi8AL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "RegionalBlues", "ChicagoBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Deadwood"}, {"Track 2": "Doctors and Dealers"}, {"Track 3": "Bang Bang You're Dead"}, {"Track 4": "Blood Thirsty Bastards"}, {"Track 5": "The Gentry Cove"}, {"Track 6": "Gin & Milk"}, {"Track 7": "The Enemy"}, {"Track 8": "If You Love a Woman"}, {"Track 9": "You Fucking Love It"}, {"Track 10": "Wondering"}, {"Track 11": "Last of the Small Town Playboys"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.16 x 12.33 x 12.32 inches; 8.8 ounces", "manufacturer": "Proper Records Uk", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "December 13, 2023", "label": "Proper Records Uk", "asin": "B0CQ4LD553", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

'Blues In Mono' finds Seasick Steve giving some of his finest performances to deliver a fresh, stripped down blues album that offers the perfect antidote for the troubled times in which we live. Steve has curated a selection of songs to cover, from his favourite artists such as Willie Dixon, Lightnin' Hopkins, Charlie Patton and Mississippi Fred McDowell. The album also features four new Seasick Steve songs, including the lead track 'Well, Well, Well'. Steve commented: \\\"It's just me and an acoustic guitar, playing old country blues. I always wanted to do it but never felt worthy, but then I realised that I better hurry up and do it 'cos I ain't never gonna feel worthy!

It's his own version of modern-day American roots music: a mix of roadhouse rock & roll, bluesy R&B, and country-fried funky-tonk, driven forward by groove, grease, and guitars. On The Ride Here, Sam Morrow's fifth studio album was produced by longtime collaborator Eric Corne, with an all-star roster of West Coast musicians - including bassist Ted Russell Kamp, keyboardist Sasha Smith, and drummers Matt Tecu and Butch Norton - adding primal punch and roughhewn Polish to the 11 songs.

Special guests include, The Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell, fast rising roots rocker Marcus King, Americana icon Buddy Miller, Scarlet Rivera of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review, Chicago blues guitar mainstay Melvin Taylor and Hawaiian ukulele star Jake Shimabukuro. Also on hand are Mayall's longtime dynamic Chicago rhythm section of Greg Rzab on bass guitar and Jay Davenport on drums with Austin's multi-talented and charismatic Carolyn Wonderland on guitar. Recorded at Robby Krieger's (The Doors) Horse Latitudes studio with Grammy nominated Producer Eric Corne, The Sun is Shining Down is Mayall's 5th studio album for Forty Below Records, a fruitful partnership that began with 2014's A Special Life. \\\"I couldn't be happier with the new record,\\\" exclaims Mayall. \\\"I can't wait to share it with my fans. Each one of these special guests brings something unique to the album and our team works so well together. I think you can hear that chemistry in the music,\\\" raves Mayall. The album explores a range of styles and eclectic instruments. Scarlet Rivera's violin beautifully compliments two Mayall originals, the timely \\\"Got to Find a Better Way\\\" and a spirited reboot of the Mayall classic \\\"Deep Blue Sea\\\". Mike Campbell sounds like a natural born Bluesbreaker on the funky Bernard Allison cut \\\"Chills and Thrills\\\" and Marcus King sizzles throughout the soulful \\\"Can't Take No More,\\\" another Mayall original. Buddy Miller's baritone tremolo guitar adds a unique and memorable flair to the Bobby Rush composition \\\"I'm as Good as Gone\\\", while Jake Shimabukuro's electric ukulele is nothing short of astonishing on \\\"One Special Lady\\\". Melvin Taylor proves why he's been wowing Chicago blues audiences for decades on \\\"Hungry and Ready\\\" and \\\"Driving Wheel\\\" and Carolyn Wonderland brilliantly concludes the record with a sensitive moving performance on the title track. As significant as each of these guest turns is, however, they can't overshadow Mayall's own spirited vocals, iconic harmonica and lyrical keyboard work on The Sun is Shining Down. \\\"John shines throughout this album, exuding a joy and gratitude that are infectious. We all want to give that back to him,\\\" adds Producer Eric Corne.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1rwlAzfNyL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Hungry and Ready (Feat.

The centerpiece of the village is the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music, dedicated to celebrating the music and musicians of New Orleans and to the education and development of homeowners and others who live nearby.For Our New Orleans, many of the Crescent City's best-known musicians recorded songs that are integral to their lives and that express their feelings about the city and the trauma of Katrina. The album was made swiftly and simply, over the course of a month, in one-day sessions across the country. Nick Spitzer, host of public radio's New Orleans-based American Routes, contributed liner notes to the record, as did Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Ford, also a Crescent City resident.

The legendary Robert Johnson stood at the crossroads of American music. He became the first modern bluesman, evolving the country blues of the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s. Johnson's life came to a premature and mysterious end in 1938, at the age of 27. By the late 1950s he had become something of a mythical figure. Some people had heard of him, but few had listened to his music. That all changed when this essential LP, King of the Delta Blues Singers, was compiled and released by Columbia in 1961. The album contains sixteen mono recordings that were originally made during two extended sessions in 1936 and 1937, and sparked a whole new generation's interest in Delta blues. It also became the first album to be inducted by the Blues Foundation into the Blues Hall of Fame. In addition to the original long play, this WaxTime collector's edition contains two bonus tracks - consisting of master takes waxed during the same dates and previously issued by Vocalion as 78s: \\\"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\\\" (which years later served as inspiration for Elmore James to write and perform his \\\"Dust My Broom\\\" rendition) and the classic \\\"Sweet Home Chicago.\\\"\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fTQ1PIVmL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "RegionalBlues", "DeltaBlues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.32 x 12.36 x 0.31 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Wax Time", "model_number": "WA-36582181", "release_date": "2019", "availability": "August 29, 2018", "label": "Wax Time", "asin": "B07FY8FC9L", "country_origin": "Belgium", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Recorded over three days at Royal Studios in Memphis (the home studio of Al Green and Hi Records in the 60s and 70s), this album is the ultimate statement of purpose for a critically acclaimed artist who has proudly carried the mantle of Mississippi Hill Country blues around the world. Over thirteen tracks, Burnside delivers his bruised but unfettered truth over blistering guitar and deep pocket drums-a sound birthed in his soul but developed and perfected on the road. But no matter how far he travels, the righteous sound he makes could only come from one place. I Be Trying is the sound of modern Mississippi. Produced by second-generation Memphis soul trailblazer Boo Mitchell (\\\"Uptown Funk\\\") and featuring guest appearances from Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars) and Zac Cockrell (Brittany Howard), I Be Trying takes the sound that Burnside learned from his grandfather, blues legend R.L.

There is a consistently restrained, warm feel across the whole work, and the band suggest that the overall theme of the album is about \\u201cthe impermanence of life in different ways: sickness, relationships, love, death and how our time is finite\\u201d.

The \\u2018Medicine\\u2019 of the title may refer to a number of salves, or the value of relationships and love: \\u201cFor our families, friends, society, this could be done through the use of psychedelics, through meditation, through learning from other people, staying curious and never settling for a \\u2018solid\\u2019 identity\\u201d.

T-Bone Walker is the source of single-note, horn-type blues soloing. In addition, his phrasing was so expressive of the blues sensibility that it has come to define the style of every electric blues and rock guitarist who has followed in his dancing footsteps. This edition includes one of Walkers finest albums, the sensational T-Bone Blues, originally released by Atlantic Records in 1960.

Rather than a reflection of life and loss and the world surrounding his Iowa horse farm on the banks of the Mississippi, \\\"Mutiny\\\" finds Whitmore's focus turned outward, to the state of country and the missteps of the government. Yet 'Animals In The Dark,' is by no means a political record. It has more in common with the preacher blues of Reverend Gary Davis or the romantic populism of Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska than it does a Billy Bragg record. What 'Animals In The Dark' highlights is the maturation and growth of an exemplary artist. On the release, Whitmore showcases his classic songwriting and mastery of the acoustic guitar and banjo, but adds elements such as strings, an organ and a pedal steel, putting the songs into full arrangements and a band context for the first time. The results are a more expansive, cultivated sound, without losing any of the palpable soul that has garnered the 30 year old such critical acclaim.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6100UVRP3oL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "TraditionalBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Mutiny"}, {"Track 2": "Who Stole the Soul"}, {"Track 3": "Johnny Law"}, {"Track 4": "Old Devils"}, {"Track 5": "Hell or High Water"}, {"Track 6": "There's Hope for You"}, {"Track 7": "Hard Times"}, {"Track 8": "Lifetime Underground"}, {"Track 9": "Let the Rain Come in"}, {"Track 10": "Good Day to Die, a"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "12.32 x 12.36 x 0.31 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Anti", "model_number": "6974-1", "release_date": "2009", "availability": "December 30, 2008", "label": "Anti", "asin": "B001NJY57Q", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": ""}

{"id": "FreddieKingnArtist_AliveinAmerica", "album_title": "\"Alive in America\"", "artist": "\"Freddie King \\n(Artist)\"", "description": "\"Freddie King (September 3, 1934 - December 28, 1976) was an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the \\\"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\\\" (along with Albert King and B.B. King, none of whom were blood related). Mostly known for his soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing, King had a major influence on electric blues music and on many later blues guitarists.King moved to Chicago when he was a teenager; there he formed his first band the Every Hour Blues Boys with guitarist Jimmie Lee Robinson and drummer Frank \\\"Sonny\\\" Scott. As he was repeatedly being rejected by Chess Records, he got signed to Federal Records, and got his break with single \\\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\\" and instrumental \\\"Hide Away\\\", which reached number five on the Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart in 1961. It later became a blues standard. King based his guitar style on Texas blues and Chicago blues influences. The album Freddy King Sings showcased his singing talents and included the record chart hits \\\"You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling\\\" and \\\"I'm Tore Down\\\". He later became involved with producers who were more oriented to rhythm and blues and rock and was one of the first bluesmen to have a multiracial backing band at performances.Nearly constant touring took it's toll on King-he was on the road almost 300 days out of the year. In 1976 he began suffering from stomach ulcers. His health quickly deteriorated, and he died on December 28 of complications from this illness and acute pancreatitis, at the age of 42. According to those who knew him, King's untimely death was due to stress, a legendary \\\"hard-partying lifestyle\\\", and a poor diet of consuming Bloody Marys because as he told a journalist, \\\"they've got food in them.\\\"King had an intuitive style, often creating guitar parts with vocal nuances. He achieved this by using the open-string sound associated with Texas blues and the raw, screaming tones of West Side, Chicago blues. King's combination of the Texas and Chicago sounds gave his music a more contemporary feel than that of many Chicago bands who were still performing 1950s-style music, and he befriended the younger generation of blues musicians.

It was quite a meditative affair, recorded very well by sound engineer Andreas Fabianek. We used a vocal mic, a guitar mic, and a few other mics to capture the natural sound of the room. The recording sounds very organic; you can feel every movement and breathing and you can literally hear the fingers dancing on the fretboard. The record was first released in 1994 on vinyl, CD and cassette. HARD ROAD BLUES has been highly acclaimed by fans and press alike and has sold very well. If a copy of this pressing ever turns up in good condition, it would cost quite a bit of money. Unfortunately, the fire devil struck at the German pressing plant - many masters and matrices were destroyed; including those of HARD ROAD BLUES. A subsequent pressing was therefore impossible. But during Corona 2020 I had a lot of time to look through my stock of recordings and I also found the HARD ROAD BLUES master tapes. That's when the idea came up to re-release this record.I contacted Christoph Stickl from CSMastering. Christoph had already done an excellent remastering of my 1987 \\\"Baby Wants To Boogie\\\" LP and he was therefore predestined to carry out this rather delicate work for HARD ROAD BLUES as well. He reviewed the tapes, which after all, were already 27 years old, and said he'd have to \\\"bake\\\" them in the oven to play them and start remastering. Luckily the tapes were still in good shape and so Christoph was able to do the remastering without interrupting the AAA chain.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91N064+nRzL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Big Bill's Guitar: Hans Theessink Manus (Akm)"}, {"Track 2": "You Make Me Feel So Good: Hans Theessink Manus (Akm)"}, {"Track 3": "Prison Blues: Trad/Arr.

Together, they're a creative force to be reckoned with, making their own version of amplified American roots music. On the pair's first collaborative album, Do The Rump, the musicians trade blistering guitar solos, take turns at the microphone, and turn their classic influences - including hill country blues, spirituals, swamp rock, and Afrobeat - into something contemporary, reinterpreting a number of their old-school favorites into eclectic, electrifying anthems. The partnership began onstage, where Simo and Dickinson first shared the spotlight as touring members of Phil Lesh and Friends. Dickinson had already established himself as co-founder of the Grammy-winning duo North Mississippi Allstars, as well as a celebrated guitarist for acts like Black Crowes and John Hiatt. Similarly, Jd Simo had built an audience not only with his solo project, but also as a session musician for Jack White, Beyonc\\u00e9, Chris Isaak, and Baz Luhrmann's Elvis movie. Occupying the same stage felt different, though. \\\"Playing with Luther immediately felt as easy as water flowing down a river,\\\" Simo remembers. \\\"We had all the same influences but we played nothing alike. Our styles just fit together. We didn't have to think about it -it was just instinctual.\\\" Those instincts take center stage on Do The Rump, whose eight songs were recorded at House of Grease, Simo's home studio in Nashville during a series of live-in-the-studio performances. There were no overdubs. No production tricks, either. Joined by drummer Adam Abarashoff - whose background in Afrobeat and jazz helped push Do The Rump's music into unexpected directions - the friends captured spontaneity in it's purest form, recording most of the songs during a single take, allowing a natural combination of grooves and guitars to lead the way.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UFFszYmmL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Side A - Street People"}, {"Track 2": "Right Down There"}, {"Track 3": "Lonesome Road"}, {"Track 4": "Come and Go with Me"}, {"Track 5": "Serves Right to Suffer"}, {"Track 6": "Side B - Do the Rump Louise"}, {"Track 7": "Come on"}, {"Track 8": "Peaches"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.11 x 12.22 x 12.02 inches; 8 ounces", "manufacturer": "Forty Below", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "June 19, 2024", "label": "Forty Below", "asin": "B0D7J5YSNB", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Following a series of line-up changes, Vanishing Twin is now the tightly honed collective of singer and multi-instrumentalist Cathy Lucas, drummer Valentina Magaletti (Holy Tongue, Tomaga, Moin) and bassist Susumu Mukai (Zongamin). Harnessing the diverse touchstones of its members; Lucas\\u2019 left-field song-craft, Magaletti\\u2019s singular approaches to experimental percussion, and Mukai\\u2019s long history in the production of electronic music, the band has refined a hypnotic sound at the juncture of minimalism, kosmische, post-punk, and dream-laden, psychedelic pop. These eight fluttering abstractions, culled, collaged, and built upon from a vast constellation of instruments, samples, and unclaimed sources. Lucas employs her voice as an instrument and a generator of raw sound, weaving surreal imagery and uncanny juxtapositions amongst the dance and propellant drive. From infectious grooves of the album\\u2019s title track and the constrained minimalism of \\u201cSubito\\u201d, to the ambitious heights of pieces like \\u2018The Down Below\\u2019 and Lazy Garden, which unfurl a psychedelic avant-gardism on the scope and scale of David Axelrod and Scott Walker.

There are also three previously unreleased tracks, which are probably the real reason to get this compilation. - Genevieve WilliamsLabel: BMG Rights \\u2013 4099964034677Format: 2 x Vinyl, LP, Compilation, GatefoldCountry: EuropeReleased: Jul 12, 2024Genre: BluesStyle: Electric BluesTracklistA1 Boogie Chillin'B2 This Is HipB3 The HealerB4 I Cover The WaterfrontB1 Boom BoomB2 I'm In The MoodB3 Burnin' HellB4 TupeloC1 Baby LeeC2 DimplesC3 Chill Out (Things Gonna Change)D1 Big Legs Tight SkirtD2 Don't Look BackD3 Up And Down\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81khCzHvSwL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Boogie Chillen - By John Lee Hooker & Eric Clapton"}, {"Track 2": "This Is Hip - By John Lee Hooker & Ry Cooder"}, {"Track 3": "The Healer - By John Lee Hooker & Carlos Santana"}, {"Track 4": "I Cover The Waterfront - By John Lee Hooker & Van Morrison"}]}, {"Disc 2": [{"Track 1": "Boom Boom - By John Lee Hooker & Jimmie Vaughan"}, {"Track 2": "I'm in the Mood - By John Lee Hooker & Bonnie Raitt"}, {"Track 3": "Burnin' Hell - By John Lee Hooker & Ben Harper"}, {"Track 4": "Tupelo"}]}, {"Disc 3": [{"Track 1": "Baby Lee"}, {"Track 2": "Dimples - By John Lee Hooker & Los Lobos"}, {"Track 3": "Chill Out (Things Gonna Change) - By John Lee Hooker & Carlos Santana"}]}, {"Disc 4": [{"Track 1": "Big Legs, Tight Skirt - By John Lee Hooker & Ike Turner"}, {"Track 2": "Don't Look Back - By John Lee Hooker & Charles Brown"}, {"Track 3": "Up and Down"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.21 x 12.41 x 12.32 inches; 1.07 Pounds", "manufacturer": "BMG", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "May 31, 2024", "label": "BMG", "asin": "B0D53SZPX7", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "2", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Recordings for Are You Experienced had begun in late October 1966, producing a string of singles preceding the illustrious first album by the world's most famous guitarist. While recording, the future working relationship between engineer Eddie Kramer and Hendrix was forged. The debut album by The Jimi Hendrix Experience was initially issued in mono and then 'enhanced stereo' on later issues. The UK cover photography was by Bruce Flemming. Releases in Europe had the words \\\"Jimi Hendrix\\\" placed above the title. These later issues were 'enhanced stereo', with tracks listed on the back. The USA & Canadian issues were released after the band appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, along with The Who.

In the summer of 1966 Clapton left, partnering off with sometime Bluesbreaker Jack Bruce to form Cream.

Considered one of the finest guitarists and vocalists of the era, noteworthy for his then unheard of usage of a 12-string guitar, artists and bands from The Allman Brothers to The White Stripes to Taj Mahal have listed the blind bluesman as a key influence. From the start of his career in 1927, McTell cut numerous singles for Victor Records, and maintained a noteworthy level of popularity in his home of Atlanta, but like many of his contemporaries, his career skidded to a halt during World War II. McTell left music during the 1950s and later passed of a brain hemmorage in 1959. Not long after his passing would come the British blues explosion, which would not only make household names of Eric Clapton and John Mayall, but spark a renewed interest in the material of classic bluesmen like McTell. It wasn't long before innumerable collections of such material came into being, including The Early Years, which captures one of McTell's most prolific periods, from 1927 to 1933. The singles included in The Early Years include numerous singles recorded for Victor, as well as for staple labels of Delta Blues like Okeh, Vocalion, and Columbia.

Featuring 11 rowdy, blistering performances (including five songs from 2022's Crackdown, three from their 2019 debut Lonely Soul and three previously unrecorded tracks), Live In Loveland! Captures GA-20 feeding off the energy of the wall-to-wall crowd and delivering each song with raw emotion and body-shaking force. Live In Loveland! #mixes band originals and vintage covers, from early electric blues and honky-tonk country to proto rock 'n' roll, all performed live with deep feeling and punk energy. The album was recorded direct-to-tape on a vintage Tascam 388 at Plaid Room Records in Loveland, Ohio, home of the famous Colemine record label. Produced by Stubbs and engineered by Colemine owner Terry Cole, the band blasts out of the gate playing Harold Burrages' I Cry For You, before tearing into Little Walter's obscure gem My Baby's Sweeter. The previously unrecorded original Hold It One More Time proves to be an instant classic, sitting seamlessly next to the vintage covers on the album. According to guitarist Matthew Stubbs (whose resume includes playing with blues legends Charlie Musselwhite and James Cotton, among others), \\\"There is a special type of energy that is exchanged when we play in front of a live audience, and we definitely feed off of that and wanted to capture that. I love the power and energy of the best live blues albums. Historically, some of the most iconic blues and jazz records have been live ones. B.B. King's Live At The Regal changed my life. So did Hound Dog Taylor's Beware Of The Dog!, and Albert King's Live Wire/Blues Power. We really wanted to continue that tradition and do one of our own.\\\" Since they first hit the scene in 2018, GA-20 have quickly become the trailblazers of the nascent traditional blues revival. It's a movement GA-20 kicked into gear with their debut album Lonely Soul on Colemine/Karma Chief Records. Two more full length releases - including 2022's critically and popularly acclaimed Crackdown - and years of nonstop national and international touring has firmly cemented the band as one of the blues' most significant young acts, bursting at the seams with talent. In December 2022 and January 2023 respectively, legendary magazines Vintage Guitar and Guitar Player selected GA-20 for cover features. They also appear on the cover of the December/January issue of the UK's famed Blues Matters! #magazine. GA-20, according to Rolling Stone, are \\\"a pure marvel and delight\\\" who play \\\"100% blues.\\\" The UK's Guardian says, \\\"GA-20 keeps things simple and fierce... scything, growling riffs, driving grooves, blistering boogies and defiant vocals.\\\" Living Blues magazine declares, \\\"GA-20's loose, raw, high-energy approach to the blues [is] guaranteed to get anyone with a pulse on to the dance floor. Riotously happy house rockers... they deliver sweaty, raucous grooves all night long.\\\" But it's not just the critics talking, as the band receives regular radio airplay from coast to coast and all around the world, from SiriusXM's Bluesville to the BBC. Most importantly, the fanbase continues to swell, anxiously awaiting the band's next move. Amazingly, GA-20's full-length albums - 2022's groundbreaking Crackdown, 2021's tribute album GA-20 Does Hound Dog Taylor: Try It...

All his life, Eddie 9-volt has acted on instinct. Aged just 15, this old-soul artist turned away from the path of college and jobs to burst all guns blazing onto the blues club circuit of his native Atlanta, Georgia. Flash forward to 2019, and for his debut album, Left My Soul In Memphis, the prodigious multi-instrumentalist simply powered up the amps in his mobile trailer and with his brother/co-writer/producer, Lane Kelly, laid down one of the year's breakout releases, acclaimed as \\\"fresh and life-affirming\\\" by Rock & Blues Muse. \\\"Memphis was a total side project,\\\" shrugs Eddie, \\\"that ended up taking off.\\\"Now, released in 2021 on Ruf Records, Little Black Flies is the 24-year-old's most impulsive move to date. Tracked live in Atlanta's Echo Deco Studios through November 2020, once again with Lane turning the knobs, plus a who's who of the state's best musicians (including guitar icon Cody Matlock), it's an album that Eddie planned to feel like it's unfolding right in front of you - right down to the clink of bottles and loose studio banter. \\\"I've seen a trend in modern recording,\\\" he says. \\\"There's no soul. I took inspiration from Albert Collins, Otis Rush, Mike Bloomfield. All those great records were done live with their buddies and no overdubs. I wanted the playing to be spot-on - but even if we made a mistake, we kept going.\\\"Little Black Flies represents a passing of the baton to a bandleader that many credit for reinvigorating the South's proud roots scene. Born in June 1996, to a non-musical family living ten miles south of Atlanta, Eddie still remembers his fateful first guitar. \\\"I was six and it was one of those with the speaker in it - get the most bang for your buck, y'know?\\\" he muses. While manufactured pop dominated the airwaves as he came up at Union Grove High School in nearby McDonough, Eddie forked hard left, hanging with Lane and his friends, and digging back into the catalogues of blues giants like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Freddie King and Rory Gallagher. \\\"I studied the older cats,\\\" he explains, \\\"saw what made them groove and tick.\\\"\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kRL7ah9pL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Little Black Flies"}, {"Track 2": "She Got Some Money"}, {"Track 3": "Dog Me Around"}, {"Track 4": "Don't Come Around This House"}, {"Track 5": "Travelin' Man"}, {"Track 6": "3Am in Chicago"}, {"Track 7": "Reach Into Your Heart"}, {"Track 8": "Miss James"}, {"Track 9": "Back on My Feet"}, {"Track 10": "Puttin' the Kids to Bed"}, {"Track 11": "Columbus Zoo Blues"}, {"Track 12": "You Don't Have to Go"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "0.21 x 12.37 x 12.15 inches; 9.12 ounces", "manufacturer": "Ruf", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "September 12, 2024", "label": "Ruf", "asin": "B0DGRZH312", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

'Strange Pleasure', the first solo album by Texas guitarist Jimmie Vaughan, was released on CD in 1994. Produced by the brilliant Nile Rodgers and mastered by one of the greatest in the business, Bob Ludwig, 'Strange Pleasure' became the musical and sound model for many subsequent productions. It established Vaughan as a musician, singer and songwriter in his own right and was the beginning of his Tilt A Whirl Band based on chunky Hammond B3 accompaniment. When 'Strange Pleasure' was released in 1994, Jimmie Vaughan had found his own style. 'Strange Pleasure' is a creative album full of feeling. It allows Jimmie to convey an eclectic range of moods and good humor, and Jimmie always plays a compelling guitar lick or solo as only he can. A blues record at its core, the album stylistically breaks away from the rigid scheme, however, and shows influences of jazz, soul grooves and gospel vocals. Above all, the mature nature of Vaughan's vocals is astonishing. A terrific album, nominated at the time for a Grammy\\u00a9 as best modern blues album.

The band's dynamic self-penned songs sound and feel as fresh and real as the old blues they love and perform, including songs by Otis Rush, J.B.

Legendary six-fingered Chicago bluesman Theodore Roosevelt \\\"Hound Dog\\\" Taylor always knew how he wanted to be remembered, declaring, \\\"When I die they'll say, 'he couldn't play shit, but he sure made it sound good!'\\\" His first full length recording in 1971 was also the first album on now world-famous Alligator Records, Hound Dog Taylor & The HouseRockers.

I invite people to engage with the ups and downs we all experience, through this music. The blues was a black-American innovation in our history that had many facets to it. There are technical components to the blues - standards and vocal phrasing. There are also components to the blues that are more abstract, such as history, geography, even intellectual movements. In this album, I endeavored to use those building blocks to articulate the humanity I see around me - past, present, and future - without compromising the quality, the foundation that the blues provides.

However, in Dave's own words, \\\"Some-times Fate, or God or the Universe, gives you a rare chance to prove an old saying is wrong.\\\" The brothers' new album, appropriately titled Lost Time, does just that. Over Lost Time's twelve tracks, Dave and Phil pay homage to a number of artists and songs that had an early, formative influence, in Dave's words \\\"the masters of the Blues, the most transcendental form of American music.\\\" Everyone from Lead Belly to James Brown is represented, but the figure who looms largest on the album, and in the brothers' own musical journey, is Big Joe Turner. The Alvins met Big Joe as teenagers, and he would mentor them for the remainder of his life. They remain his humble students, and cut four Turner songs for Lost Time.If their GRAMMY-nominated 2014 album Common Ground was the sound of a partnership rekindled, Lost Time is a four-alarm fire. Dave's guitar work slithers and stings as never before, and Phil's feral howl cuts to the core. Dave and Phil both sing and play guitar throughout Lost Time, and are joined by a crack band including Lisa Pankratz (drums), Brad Fordham (bass), and Chris Miller (guitar).The Alvin brothers founded seminal early LA punk roots band The Blasters in 1979, and after Dave left the group in 1986, they did notrecord an album together again until Common Ground. In addition to its Grammy nomination, that record earned wide critical acclaim,, and features with NPR's Fresh Air, The LA Times, Wall Street Journal and more. Dave and Phil will tour extensively behind Lost Time with Dave's band The Guilty Ones.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KYHYBN4VL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "ElectricBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Mister Kicks"}, {"Track 2": "World's in a Bad Condition"}, {"Track 3": "Cherry Red Blues"}, {"Track 4": "Rattlesnakin' Daddy"}, {"Track 5": "Hide and Seek"}, {"Track 6": "Papas on the House Top"}]}, {"Disc 2": [{"Track 1": "In New Orleans (Rising Sun Blues)"}, {"Track 2": "Please Please Please"}, {"Track 3": "Sit Down Baby"}, {"Track 4": "Wee Baby Blues"}, {"Track 5": "Feeling Happy"}, {"Track 6": "If You See My Savior"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "5.55 x 4.96 x 0.12 inches; 2.33 ounces", "manufacturer": "Yep Roc Records", "model_number": "LPYEP2447", "release_date": "2015", "availability": "June 23, 2015", "label": "Yep Roc Records", "asin": "B0106US0YG", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": "33 minutes"}

{"id": "DavyKnowles_WhatHappensNext", "album_title": "\"What Happens Next\"", "artist": "\"Davy Knowles\"", "description": "\"Since he was a teen, guitarist and singer-songwriter, Davy Knowles, has shown fierce dedication and devotion to the blues. As a solo artist and a member of Back Door Slam, he conjured the rock-tinged majesty of 1960s Brit-blues; the dazzling virtuosity of 1960s Chicago electric blues; and the hypnotic, one-chord thump of North Mississippi Hill country blues. For his oeuvre and his fiery performances, legendary guitarists and respected musical instrument and accessory companies have heaped on accolades and awarded him brand partnerships. On his Provogue Records' debut, aptly titled 'What Happens Next', Knowles bravely takes the step beyond resting on his laurels, his hard-fought credibility, and his widely recognized instrumental prowess. He puts it all on the line with timeless and cohesive songwriting, sleek and nuanced production, and a lyrical, play-for-the-song guitar approach informed from soul, folk, and blues. Here, the Isle of Man-born, Chicago, Illinois-based artist's poetic songwriting, and his soulfully emotive singing steal the show. What Happens Next was produced by award-winning producer, songwriter, and engineer, Eric Corne (John Mayall, Joe Walsh, Joe Bonamassa). 'What Happens Next' is something of a departure from these releases, and Knowles's fired-up and reverent take on blues and Americana. \\\"I'm not a purist, and the way for roots music to stay relevant is to adapt and progress,\\\" he shares. \\\"The field hollers Alan Lomax recorded are worlds apart from Muddy Waters' music, but they come from the same place.\\\" In this spirit, 'What Happens Next' is just as influenced by The Black Keys, Fantastic Negrito, Gary Clark Jr., as it is Muddy Waters, Junior Kimbrough, and R.L. Burnside. It is a cohesive body of work, rather than a collection of disparate songs. It offers forth a peaks-and-valleys album experience winding through brawny riffs, jazzy blues balladry, and vintage soul. \\\"This album taught me about restraint in terms of guitar playing,\\\" says Knowles. \\\"I had to reign it in to let the songs breathe, but I am looking forward to reimagining them and stretching out when we play live.\\\"\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YTcW3jwzL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Light of the Moon"}, {"Track 2": "Heartbreak or Nothing"}, {"Track 3": "Roll Me"}, {"Track 4": "Get Lucky"}, {"Track 5": "Devil and the Deep Blue Sea"}, {"Track 6": "One & the Same"}, {"Track 7": "Solid Ground"}, {"Track 8": "River"}, {"Track 9": "Side Show"}, {"Track 10": "Hell to Pay"}, {"Track 11": "Wake Me When the Nightmare Is Over"}, {"Track 12": "If I Ever Meet My Maker"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.28 x 12.28 x 0.28 inches; 9.67 ounces", "manufacturer": "Provogue", "model_number": "PRD76601", "release_date": "2022", "availability": "July 28, 2021", "label": "Provogue", "asin": "B09BC766VF", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

{"id": "BBKing_EasyListeningBlues", "album_title": "\"Easy Listening Blues\"", "artist": "\"B.B. King\"", "description": "\"Limited 180gm vinyl LP pressing including bonus material. This collector's release includes B.B. King's all-instrumental 1962 LP Easy Listening Blues, which marks King's tenth budget-priced album. The album title is a bit misleading, considering that King, who might be smooth and urbane in some respects, rarely recorded music that could be categorized as \\\"easy listening.\\\" Although this material is lesser known than the bulk of King's popular repertoire, it is in no way inferior. The blues giant imbues each number with a spectrum of moods, ranging from a subdued quality (\\\"Blues for Me\\\" and \\\"Walkin'\\\") to highly charged intensity (\\\"Rambler\\\" and \\\"Shoutin' the Blues\\\"). King also plays here with his usual authority, making occasional nods toward the rock & roll twist craze on cuts like \\\"Night Long\\\" and \\\"Hully Gully.\\\" The tunes were recorded in Los Angeles, in 1962, as part of the stockpiling process before B.B. King switched to the ABC-Paramount label. He is backed on the album by Lloyd Glenn on piano, Maxwell Davis on organ, Ralph Hamilton on bass, and Jesse Sailes on drums (no horns were booked for the dates). Formal arrangements were kept to a minimum, with relaxed and elegant readings of \\\"Confessin',\\\" \\\"Slow Walk\\\" (re-titled \\\"Slow Burn\\\" when it reappeared on a Kent single some years later), and \\\"Walkin'.\\\" \\\"Don't Touch\\\" recalls past glories by utilizing the principal riff from King's Latin-tinged 1953 smash \\\"Woke Up This Morning\\\" as it's starting point. \\\"Shoutin' the Blues\\\" takes a similar tack, quoting from the broom-dusting beginning of another 1953 King classic, \\\"Please Love Me,\\\" before breaking into a salty shuffle. Because there have been so few purely instrumental releases by King, this album should be considered an essential part of his discography. In addition to the original masterpiece, this collector's LP includes two bonus tracks, \\\"Talkin' the Blues,\\\" and the catchy R&B tune \\\"3 O'Clock Stomp,\\\" both of which are instrumentals that were cut during the same period.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oXMWCedUL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "", "dimensions": "12.32 x 12.36 x 0.31 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Pan Am", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2019", "availability": "August 29, 2018", "label": "Pan Am", "asin": "B07FXQVP5V", "country_origin": "Spain", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

There was always music around myhouse, but as a teenager, I started digging deeper and deeper in to the blues records in myDad's collection. That was when I started to get the Fred Davis story in fits and starts. Fredcould play like T-Bone Walker and sang in a high, keen voice like J.B. Lenoir, he said. He usedto front a jump band in Kansas City, before something went down that sent him to prison atLeavenworth. In the summer of 1967, he ended up working alongside my Dad at Harco, theCleveland factory where my grandfather was an executive. They became friends, bonding overthe B.B. King and Bobby Bland records blaring from the AM radio on the factory floor.Fred taught my Dad the rudiments of blues guitar, but his style. Instead of barring with his firstfinger, he wrapped his thumb around the back of the neck. That left his other fingers free tocreate big, ringing voicings that imitated the Kansas City horn sections he heard in his youth.Fred could play up and down the neck and, even when he played and sang just by himself, hesounded like a full band. Or, at least, so the legend went. These were only foggy memories fromthirty years previous, passed down from a father to a son.But then we found the tape. A quarter inch reel in a plain white cardboard box, hiding on a shelfin the attic. My Dad explained how it came to exist: He found some friends (acquaintancesreally) who had a band and some equipment. They setup in my grandparents living room wherethe upright piano was, and he invited Fred over to record some of his songs with the bandbacking him up. Invited him over, to play loud music, in his boss's living room. Sounds likesomething I would have done. The idea was that maybe if there were some recordings of Fredthat he could use them to get booked on the nascent college blues-revival circuit, but it wasn't tobe.We found a place nearby that could dub the tape and put it on a CD for us. When we finally gotthe transfer back, the legend became real. Fred really COULD sing like J.B. Lenoir and play likeT-Bone Walker. He really DID have his own style. And that style had now been passed on tome. Without even realizing it, I had learned to play like Fred Davis. Even now, when I sit down toplay the guitar or write a song and I wrap my thumb around the neck, I'm playing like he did.With this music now professionally transferred and remastered, I can only hope that Fred Daviscan finally receive the acclaim that he deserves; that he never received in his lifetime. Thelegend can finally go behind the confines of my living room and, with any luck, to the wholeworld.\\\"- Eli Paperboy Reed, fall 2022\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ubuXw2zRL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Wine Hop"}, {"Track 2": "Drifting Blues"}, {"Track 3": "Express Train"}, {"Track 4": "Midnight Is Falling (Acoustic)"}, {"Track 5": "Piano Boogie"}, {"Track 6": "Time When You Say You Love Me"}, {"Track 7": "Midnight Is Falling"}, {"Track 8": "Euclid Avenue"}, {"Track 9": "Five Long Years"}, {"Track 10": "Wine Hop (Acoustic)"}, {"Track 11": "Tell Me Pretty Baby"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "0.19 x 12.47 x 12.19 inches; 12.48 ounces", "manufacturer": "Colemine Records", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "September 14, 2023", "label": "Colemine Records", "asin": "B0CJ4278WZ", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

And there might be a reason for that\\u2026you see, it has been revealed that the Power label enlisted the aid of some very, very interesting musicians for some of its projects. For instance, the imprint\\u2019s 1966 album Batman and Robin by The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was actually produced by Tom Wilson of Bob Dylan, Velvet Underground, and Mothers of Invention fame\\u2014and the band was made up free jazz legend Sun Ra and members of The Blues Project! Which has led to all sorts of speculation about who Frankie Stein and His Ghouls actually were; among the names bandied about are guitarist Duane Eddy, jazz saxophonist Max Greger, and, yes, Sun Ra and the Blues Project again. At any rate, prepare yourself for frenetic rock-and-twist workouts punctuated by deranged howls and shattering sound effects.

Produced by three-time Grammy winner Larry Campbell, its a wonderfully curated selection of deep cuts from the blues genre, in addition to luminous originals and traditional material given the Bromberg treatment. David found his inspiration for the album when he heard Willie Nelson repeat a quote from Texas fiddler Johnny Gimble: There s only two kinds of music - the Star-Spangled Banner and the Blues. Propelled by Brombergs unparalleled playing and gift for interpretation, a crack band and Campbells tasteful horn arrangements, the album takes us to electrifying heights as well as intimate acoustic moments on his arrangements of songs by Robert Johnson, Bobby Charles, George Little Hat Jones, Ray Charles, and Sonny Boy Williamson and others. David puts his unmistakable stamp on these chestnuts, then digs deep into the historical archives for such mysterious musical nuggets as How Come My Dog Don t Bark When You Come Round? and 900 Miles, an old country song imagined as if Howling Wolf were to play it. Bromberg may be singing the blues, but this is anything but a downer as he proves that hes still as entertaining, brilliant and witty as when his career began in 1971.

Hooker's lyrical approach is more akin to what one might expect of a jazz musician - he is literally improvising on the spot, taking any given subject matter and shape-shifting the words to paint a picture instantaneously. 'I Got Eyes For You' is a great example of extemporaneous vocal alchemy. On 'Burnin' Hell', Hooker pounds out a rhythmic chord pattern while singing lyrics that reveal his mama and daddy telling him to go ask \\\"Deacon Jones\\\" to pray for him: \\\"Ain't no burnin' hell... where I go, nobody [can] tell... \\\" Like a jazz saxophonist, he's improvising the lyric as he's telling a story - repeating the phrases, describing his feelings, grunting, agreeing, cajoling, using words to create verbal tension before the rhythmic vocal thrust explodes into instrumental ecstasy that inevitably follows. Listen to how he weaves his way through the lyrics of 'Tease Me Baby (aka Tease Me Over Baby)'. Hooker never uses a pick on his right hand - only his bare fingers to get the sound that creates such propulsive energy in every one of his performances. His thumb is his bass player, which he uses exclusively to play amazing walking bass lines and low-register countermelodies, while his index finger does the heavy lifting for all the single-note solo lines, as can be heard on 'Grinder Man'. His middle and ring-fingers are his simultaneous harmony-keepers and rhythm makers. Often, he combines them together in a pattern using fast-flickering alternation between thumb and index finger, as demonstrated in 'Black Cat Blues'. Hooker can hit a chord and ring it to death with that intense, repetitious wrangling that is the most joyful blues noise ever heard. He generally uses two primary tuning setups - one is a normal E tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E, from low string to high string); 'Walkin' This Highway' is a one-chord blues vamp in the key of E. The other is an open A tuning where he raises the pitch on the D, G, and B strings up a whole step to create a resonant, sonorous (E-A-E-A-C#-E) harmony, which where he raises the pitch on the D, G, and B strings up a whole step to create a resonant, sonorous (E-A-E-A-C#-E) harmony, which is ideal for right-hand, open-chord strumming. This can be heard on the splendid alternate take of 'Boogie Chillen' [on side one]. And then, of course, there's that non-stop, ever-present clap-clap-clap of his footwork - the unflappable drummer in this wondrous one-man band. He's literally stompin' the blues - just listen to the groove on 'How Can You Do It', as well as on 'Roll 'N' Roll', which later had a direct influence on Muddy Waters' own version, called 'Rollin' And Tumblin'. In a moment rarely captured on tape, Hooker does a bit of scat-singing on 'The Story of a Married Woman' after he exclaims, \\\"I'm in love with the woman, scared to call her name, she's a married woman may get somebody killed. \\\" Also rare is the piano accompaniment (by James Watkins) on 'Let Your Daddy Ride', one of the few recorded tracks that doesn't solely feature Hooker's guitar work. Recorded by Bernard Besman for the Sensation label between 1948-1952, this unique collection of songs captures the unique style of John Lee Hooker which forever changed the soundscape of American music.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A16k6z+rnWL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Burnin' Hell"}, {"Track 2": "Walkin' This Highway"}, {"Track 3": "Grinder Man"}, {"Track 4": "Black Cat Blues"}, {"Track 5": "How Can You Do It"}, {"Track 6": "Boogie Chillen' #2"}, {"Track 7": "Boogie Chillen'"}, {"Track 8": "Roll 'N' Roll"}, {"Track 9": "The Story of a Married Woman"}, {"Track 10": "Tease Me Baby (Tease Your Daddy)"}, {"Track 11": "I Got Eyes for You"}, {"Track 12": "Let Your Daddy Ride"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.18 x 12.36 x 11.66 inches; 9.28 ounces", "manufacturer": "Ace Records Uk", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "August 17, 2024", "label": "Ace Records Uk", "asin": "B0DD464SJL", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

That band was the Sound Machine, a band he literally created himself out of members of his own family, blending raw Mississippi blues with soul, funk, R&B, and other urban flavors to make a marvelous amalgam of his own. Contemporary beats and modern themes like \\\"Bad Luck City,\\\" \\\"Searching for My Baby,\\\" \\\"Can't Let You Go,\\\" and \\\"Sound Machine Groove\\\" sit nicely alongside slower, traditional material like \\\"Going Down South\\\" and \\\"Begged for a Nickel,\\\" while R.L.'s duets with drummer Calvin Jackson on \\\"Goin' Away Baby\\\" and \\\"Long Haired Doney\\\" show a marvelous empathy and interplay. Especially notable is a version of \\\"Sitting on Top of the World\\\" with Burnside on slide guitar that, with Jackson's help, neatly evokes the sound and feel of a fife and drum band. Although Burnside was hailed by the 1990's blues crowd as something of an overnight success, one listen to this disc tells you he was already forging a new chapter in the Mississippi blues tradition with these recordings\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DsWD5D3oL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "11.73 x 0.12 x 11.73 inches; 8.47 ounces", "manufacturer": "Highwater Records", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "April 20, 2023", "label": "Highwater Records", "asin": "B0C34BV298", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

This 10\\\" vinyl LP contains music that cemented the style of one of the greats of the Mississippi blues and later of Chicago rhythm and blues. Between May 1951 and early 1953 the Howlin' Wolf, Chester Burnett, made his first-ever recording sessions. They took place in Tennessee at the Memphis Recording Service, where producer and engineer Sam Phillips was not afraid to take a chance on a singer who was already over forty years old and whose then small claim to fame was a local radio show across the river at KWEM in West Memphis. In fact, nothing would have stopped Phillips recording the Wolf. Phillips was captivated by his voice. He was the first to hear and understand the man's potential. Sam Phillips said that he heard Wolf on the radio and got word to him at KWEM that he would be interested in recording him. He placed him under contract in spring 1951, and sold Wolf's recordings to Chess Records in Chicago. The first release, How Many More Years, became a national number four R&B chart hit that summer. Chester Burnett, the Howlin' Wolf, only recorded in Memphis for two years, but that was time enough for him and his band with the ingenious guitarist Willie Johnson to perfect many of his trademark phrases, howls, rhythms, riffs, and solos.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oCIW5DGFL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "RegionalBlues", "MemphisBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "(Everybody's) in the Mood"}, {"Track 2": "My Last Affair (Take1)"}, {"Track 3": "Look-A-Here Baby"}, {"Track 4": "How Many More Years"}, {"Track 5": "Bluebird Blues"}, {"Track 6": "Oh Red (Take2)"}, {"Track 7": "Chocolate Drop"}, {"Track 8": "My Troubles and Me"}, {"Track 9": "I Got a Woman / Sweet Woman"}, {"Track 10": "California Boogie"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.18 x 10.39 x 10.36 inches; 7.36 ounces", "manufacturer": "Bear Family", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "December 5, 2022", "label": "Bear Family", "asin": "B0BPB91HWZ", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": "45 minutes"}

What prompted the decision to make a blues album? I've been making blues recordings since the early 1980s. We've made a few Chatham Singers LPs over the years and I've been meaning to record another and just got round to it. I'm still making regular CTMF recordings at the same sessions it's just the fun of working with different sounds. I was listening to Slim Harpo ('Got Love If You Want It') in a cafe, Jim form Ranscombe Studios was having a coffee and I said \\\"this is a great song, we should try to get that echo chamber going.\\\" Next day he said he'd been messing with it and I said \\\"right, let's record!\\\" How does this differ from the previous two Chatham Singers albums? Less country, no poetry, more developed sound, otherwise the same. It features fantastic blues harp playing by guest player Jim Riley, tell us a bit about him. Jim plays with us on the other LPs as well, I just wanted to highlight that a bit on this LP. I've known Jim since '77 when he was in the local R&B group, Wipeout, and I was in the local punk outfit The Pop Rivets. We played together a few times and became pals back then. Jim now runs the local studio where we record with my drum kit from Thee Mighty Caesars. You've really captured that authentic gritty urban blues sound. Gearheads will want to know what guitars and amps you used? My same old Selmer Truevoice guitar 15 amp I've used since the Milkshakes, a 15 Selmer bass combo (15 quid from Rochester flea market. A '59 Jazzmaster guitar and an old Hagstrom bass that Thee Headcoats got on the cheap in Seattle What do you think those other Kent-born musicians, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger would make of the album and how does it compare to their work? We got the sound of that Chess Studios echo chamber, so I guess they'd be pretty envious.

He not only revolutionised harmonica playing by using amplification to compete with the growling guitars of the Chicago blues movement, he changed the way the harp was perceived and opened up a new world of instrumentation. Walter purposely pushed his amplifiers beyond their intended technical limitations to explore and develop radical new timbres and sonic effects previously unheard from a harmonica or indeed, any other instrument. This natural distortion opened musicians ears to the possibilities of their own instruments and, in many ways, laid the foundations for the blues boom to come along in the sixties. Walter was the first, and to this point, only artist to have a No.1 hit with his self-penned, harp led instrumental Juke. He went on to have numerous R&B chart hits before succumbing to his wild, violent and hard drinking life-style. This LP features all Little Walters biggest R&B chart hits from his debut No.1 Juke, to his last chart entry in 1959, the ironically titled Everything Gonna Be Alright.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91o2BMxNDiL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "HarmonicaBlues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.2 x 12.2 x 0.28 inches; 10.4 ounces", "manufacturer": "Acrobat", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "July 12, 2023", "label": "Acrobat", "asin": "B0C9R72MWK", "country_origin": "United Kingdom", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Somehow after recording nine hot blues tracks, I got another album concept so we started another album session. I said we'd get back to the blues album soon after finishing the new project. As things sometimes go, we got busy with gigging, touring and life. That early blues album we cut kept getting put aside and we kept coming up with new album concepts within months of release of the last one. Finally, after two decades and dozens of recordings, we got to the place where it was time for my final Stony Plain record. All this time I knew we had to get back to the album we had started back in 2005. I knew those tracks were really strong but until I listened to them again, I didn't realize just how strong they really were.\\\" - Duke RobillardDuke Robillard is a legacy blues artist who launched his career with A Roomful of Blues in 1967, joined the Fabulous Thunderbirds, played with the Legendary Blues Band, was one-third of the New Guitar Summit, leads his own band and continues to do solo shows, now in his 75th year.

{"id": "EdHarcourtnArtist_ElMagnifico", "album_title": "\"El Magnifico\"", "artist": "\"Ed Harcourt \\n(Artist)\"", "description": "\"Ed Harcourt has released music under his own name that blends raw emotions, impeccable songwriting and visionary flights of imagination. He made his debut with the Mercury Prize-nominated, Here Be Monsters, in 2001, and a succession of ten rich, enthralling albums have followed including the intoxicating addictive Strangers (2004); the breathless Back Into The Woods (2013), which was recorded in just eight hours; and Furnaces (2016) which compellingly and entreatingly envisioned family ties confronted by the small matter of the apocalypse. Harcourt then moved onto explore the instrumental sphere with recent soundscape albums Beyond The End (2018) and Monochrome To Colour (2020). While recognizably bearing all the hallmarks that have made him such an admired and prolific songwriter, his new record, El Magnifico, also finds him striving for something new. It is an Ed Harcourt record, but one with a desire to seek fresh reward. \\\"I think as a songwriter you do get to a point where you're aware of your past and what you've done,\\\" suggests Harcourt of the album's mixture of assuredness and aspiration. \\\"It's knowing what your strengths are, what your weaknesses are, but also knowing how to better yourself by doing things you haven't done before.\\\" The record was produced in his studio at the bottom of his garden, while also making use of the natural resonance of his local church to capture the album's array of string parts. It was completed with the input of friend and producer Dave Izumi Lynch at Eastbourne's Echo Zoo studio. El Magnifico's spirit owes much to Harcourt's initial writing and recording approach, an experience that saw him revel in creative freedom as he indulged his impulses and tried not to outthink instincts. Though it's title was coined in jest, as his new album attests what Ed Harcourt does is proving to be fittingly magnificent.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rcvv-EcyL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "JumpBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "1987"}, {"Track 2": "Into the Loving Arms of Your Enemy"}, {"Track 3": "Broken Keys"}, {"Track 4": "Strange Beauty"}, {"Track 5": "The Violence of the Rose"}, {"Track 6": "Ghost Ship"}, {"Track 7": "Deathless"}, {"Track 8": "Anvils & Hammers"}, {"Track 9": "My Heart Can't Keep Up with My Mind"}, {"Track 10": "At the Dead End of the World"}, {"Track 11": "Seraphina"}, {"Track 12": "El Magnifico"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.36 x 12.36 x 12.33 inches; 10.56 ounces", "manufacturer": "Deathless Recordings", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "November 22, 2023", "label": "Deathless Recordings", "asin": "B0CNTZVGJJ", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Standing six feet three inches he was a mountain of a man whose menacing vocal and low down 'n' dirty delivery greatly influenced a whole generation of rockers who followed. Born Chester Burnett, Wolf was one of the most important and influential figures in Chicago Blues through the 1950s. Rougher-edged than Muddy Waters, the intensity of Wolf's performance prompted Sun Records impresario, Sam Phillips, to observe: When I heard Howlin' Wolf, I said: 'This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies'. Pressed on 140g black vinyl, this 16-track LP features the bluesman's best-loved songs from the first decade or more of his recording career, comprising songs from his 1951 debut recording for Phillips in Memphis, through to 1962 by which time commercial blues had become focused on the middle-class, white student market as much as its traditional black roots.

When Lou Rawls (1933-2006) entered the recording studio in LA in February 1962 to record his first album, 'Stormy Monday' in collaboration with Les McCann's combo, hardly anyone could have guessed what success and popularity the black singer, songwriter, producer and film actor would achieve in the coming decades. In 1966 he made his breakthrough with Love Is A Hurtin' Thing and reached the top of the R&B charts. But besides the song selection and Lou Rawls' goose-bump producing voice, the small combo of Les McCann - also known as Ltd. - must be credited for the incredibly coherent production. Part of the recordings were made during a night session, which must be regarded as one of the gentlest and most relaxed recording sessions in history. With 'Stormy Monday' Rawls and McCann turn away from the then popular 'Neo-Gospel' or 'Soul-Jazz'. Their wonderful arrangements are reminiscent of the great R&B of the early 50s.

The follow-up to his multiple award-winning, critically acclaimed 2021 album, Dear America, Ridin' is a continuation of the vision that informs Bibb's artistry as a modern-day Blues troubadour. Grounded in the folk and blues tradition with contemporary sensibilities, Bibb's music continues to reflect his thoughts on current world events and his own lived experiences, whilst remaining entertaining, uplifting, inspirational and relevant. A two-time Grammy Award nominee with multiple Blues Foundation awards, Eric Bibb is known and revered globally for having carved his own musical destiny with honesty and power. Eric's father, the late Leon Bibb, was an activist, actor, and folk singer who marched at Selma with Dr. Martin Luther King. Eric's youth was spent immersed in the Greenwich Village folk scene. Names like Dylan, Baez, and Seeger were visitors to his home. He was deeply influenced by Odetta, Richie Havens, and Taj Mahal - who guests on Ridin' - and he has synthesized all of that into his very own style.   Review   (FIVE STARS) With a steely-eyed calm resting atop a cauldron of emotional heat, troubadour extraordinaire Eric Bibb delivers messages at times disturbing, at other times reassuring, and always compelling. Taj Mahal guests on a surefire pleaser, 'Blues Funky Like Dat'. The history contained in 'Tulsa Town' and 'The Ballad of John Howard Griffin' should cause for reflection and Mr. Bibb's powerful readings of '500 Miles' and 'Sinner Man' stand out as well. --Duane Verh, Roots Music Report\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JW2L9UsBL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "TraditionalBlues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.33 x 12.44 x 12.42 inches; 1.13 Pounds", "manufacturer": "Stony Plain Music", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "January 17, 2023", "label": "Stony Plain Music", "asin": "B0BRMZHC5D", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "2", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

How do you move forward when the present moment is rife with mounting challenges \\u2014 when you\\u2019re caught between the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future? Running From the Chase was written in part through a time of intense personal hardship for Harrington, but it was through these struggles he and his bandmates gained a deeper appreciation of the power of their shared creative endeavor, both the cathartic release found in the dynamic squall of their music and in the friendships forged by this communal pursuit. Their album doesn\\u2019t have an easy answer to Harrington\\u2019s searching question, but under these songs\\u2019 bruising exteriors, you can hear the sound of a band looking towards one another to learn how to move forward. \\\"Running From the Chase\\\" was recorded with producer and engineer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Snail Mail, Angel Olsen) at Asheville\\u2019s Drop of Sun Studios through the spring and summer of 2022. Farrar immediately made them feel right at home, which allowed the band to bring a sense of curiosity, commitment, and experimentation to the process. Dynamics were considered in songwriting as well as sequencing; off-kilter \\u201c77x\\u201d builds an eerie scene over a minimal slowcore foundation before the following track \\u201cClover\\u201d thrusts into a playful headbanger.

This music is the oldest still-practiced post-colonial American music, and Turner was one of it's greatest artists of the 20th century. Blowing the cane fife with a band of drummers as back up, The Rising Star Fife And Drum band was legendary in the hills of Tate County, Mississippi, where they would perform during the yearly goat picnics on Turner's farm. These tracks were recorded by Luther Dickinson during such picnics and released when Turner was ninety years old. Everybody Hollerin' Goat shows first hand the hypnotic and rhythmic style of fife and drum music at it's best-raw and beautiful. It is every bit as essential a document of America's folk-music heritage as anything Harry Smith or Alan Lomax ever offered up for posterity. Turner's band included some of his children and grandchildren that have gone on to continue the fife and drum tradition since his death in 2003.

The eight-decade story of how a Mississippi cotton-picker rose to the heights of the blues - changing the genre forever with his soul-drenched voice and 'one-note' touch - is told by his acclaimed studio catalogue and fabled live shows. Now, as the men who walked alongside him every step of the way for over 35 years, The B.B.

There's the addictive brass-bolstered shuffle of Low Down. The slow-burn balladry of She's The One. The spring-heeled funk of Taking Care Of Business, and trumpet legend James 'Boogaloo' Bolden's own Hey There Pretty Woman. Joe Louis Walker gives a soulful hat-tip on Regal Blues - while the King would surely approve of Louisiana gunslinger Kenny Wayne Shepherd's masterful solo on opener Irene Irene. As Harvey says: \\\"This record is a representation of B.B.'s musical styles and influences, to those who never got to hear or see him live.\\\" Mission accomplished, with The Soul Of The King making a bracing return to some of King's greatest cuts. There's a heartfelt turn from Michael Lee on The Thrill Is Gone. Mary Griffin and Taj Mahal combine their vocal and guitar talents on Paying The Cost To Be The Boss.

Following up on the rave reviews garnered by Rebel Moon Blues, Sass continues to mine her talent as a blues singer with 8 new tracks on Bitches Blues. Reflecting on the impact the past two years has had on us all, Sass has recorded songs that examine the visceral emotional territory of a pandemic, and the multiple conflicts that the world is reeling from in the aftermath. \\\"Still Alive and Well' is Sass's triumphant take on a Rick Derringer song that leads off the album. Her original song, \\\"Still The World Goes Round\\\" marks the mid-point with a look at power structures, both within and without, while another new creation \\\"Change Is Coming\\\" ends the collection with a trance-like chant that offers an uplifting perspective. As we have come to expect from Sass, the album features fierce guitar licks, driving tempo's, the raw and soulful Sass Jordan rasp, and a glorious assortment of rambling road dogs, known as the Champagne Hookers.

{"id": "BrotherDege_AuroraBlackGoldMarble", "album_title": "\"Aurora - Black / Gold Marble\"", "artist": "\"Brother Dege\"", "description": "\"Gatefold LP (black/gold marble vinyl) with padded inner sleeve and protection sleeve (500 copies). If you make the trek down to Louisiana, you won't leave the same way you came. Listening to Brother Dege, you breathe in the backwoods air, fall under the spell of the swamp, and get to know the ghosts of the Delta. Materialising at a crossroads between soul-rousing rock and roll, eloquent folk, graveyard Americana, and psychedelic bliss, the GRAMMY Award-nominated troubadour absorbs the spirit of his home state in threads of droning slide guitar, naked vocals, and blood-soaked poetry. On Brother Dege's sixth full-length \\\"Aurora\\\", after quietly generating tens of millions of streams, earning widespread acclaim, and carving out a corner in pop culture history with a co-sign by none other than Quentin Tarantino, the American guitarist and singer Dege Legg pulls everyone into his lush musical world. An undercurrent of bluesy distortion tosses and turns in tectonic motion beneath bold hooks as his love for seventies and eighties staples funnels into a twisted 21st century take on Southern rock. He emerges out of this smoke with a vision without comparison, bringing grit and gusto in equal measure to Alt-Americana. During 2004, when Dege Legg emerged as Brother Dege, he introduced his already fully-developed unique sound via the album debut \\\"Trailerville\\\". In it's wake, the sophomore full-length \\\"Folk Songs of the American Longhair\\\" yielded a procession of anthems, including 'Too Old to Die Young', which Tarantino personally selected to play over a key sequence in \\\"Django Unchained\\\" and to grace the tracklist of the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Dege parlayed this momentum into a string of fan favourite albums, namely \\\"How To Kill A Horse\\\" (2013), \\\"Scorched Earth Policy\\\" (2015), and \\\"Farmer's Almanac\\\" (2018). There can be no denying that Brother Dege is heavily influenced by the music and sound of the Deep South, against which he rebelled in his youth. Yet even while the roots remain strong, the American guitarist and singer transcends his song another step further into the universal language of rock and roll with his new masterpiece \\\"Aurora\\\". Lean back, close your eyes, and let these wonderful songs engulf you.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N8vBK0psL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Aurora"}, {"Track 2": "Where the Black Flowers Grow"}, {"Track 3": "Climbing Ivy"}, {"Track 4": "A Man Needs a Mommy"}, {"Track 5": "Turn of the Screw"}, {"Track 6": "Ouroboros"}, {"Track 7": "The Devil You Know"}, {"Track 8": "Loser's Blues"}, {"Track 9": "The Longing"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.3 x 12.79 x 12.74 inches; 10.72 ounces", "manufacturer": "Prophecy", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "January 18, 2024", "label": "Prophecy", "asin": "B08LRZTYX6", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

But he's so convincing a player that the concept of \\\"blues guitar hero\\\" might get a good name again, even with fans dead-tired of excess who never thought they'd think things like, \\\"Man, can Melvin Taylor play the ever-loving (add the expletive superlative of your choice) out of the guitar\\\" again. Taylor's first real-time release, Melvin Taylor & the Slack Band, is a pretty straightforward affair - basic trio with minimal overdubs, serviceable vocals in an Albert King mode, and a mix of originals and very classic covers. The opening \\\"Texas Flood\\\" let's him rip on a slow blues, constantly changing up his playing with wah-wah blitzes as the real ace in his sonic hole. The originals \\\"Depression Blues\\\" and \\\"Groovin' in New Orleans\\\" add some funk flair, while \\\"Talking to Anna Mae\\\" is a straight-up Chicago boogie instrumental that Taylor shines on. But he's even more in his element on the unadorned slow blues \\\"Tin Pan Alley\\\" and King's \\\"Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong.\\\" It's partly the speed but even more the phrasing - the unexpected stops and starts, the spiky and blazing runs and flurries, the unusual note selections he tosses in - that sets his playing apart. The other covers have their sporadic moments - \\\"T-Bone Shuffle\\\" is inconsequential, but Otis Rush's \\\"All Your Love\\\" and \\\"Voodoo Chile\\\" are worth listening to, even if the latter doesn't add anything to the famous Hendrix wah-wah workout. Taylor actually doesn't sound that radical here, like he was playing to establish blues circuit credentials by putting his stamp on familiar songs more than indulging offbeat personal touches like the mellow lounge jazz take on the Champs' \\\"Tequila.\\\" But his playing can be truly electrifying and Melvin Taylor & the Slack Band is recommended for anyone, especially Stevie Ray Vaughan fans, looking for a distinctive new blues guitar voice.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IAMFPDoyL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Texas Flood"}, {"Track 2": "Depression Blues"}, {"Track 3": "Grooving in New Orleans"}, {"Track 4": "Talking to Anna Mae"}, {"Track 5": "Tin Pan Alley"}, {"Track 6": "All Your Love (I Miss Loving)"}, {"Track 7": "Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong"}, {"Track 8": "T-Bone Shuffle"}, {"Track 9": "Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)"}, {"Track 10": "Tequila"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.01 x 12.39 x 11.94 inches; 7.36 ounces", "manufacturer": "Pure Pleasure", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2024", "availability": "November 10, 2023", "label": "Pure Pleasure", "asin": "B0CLMD4619", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Their first album \\\"Reflections\\\" (AKA \\\"Junior's Wailing\\\") was released in 1969. Pete Sears played piano on this album before he joined Rod Stewart on his four early classic recordings. Pugh also played on Rod Stewart's first solo album, \\\"The Rod Stewart Album\\\" (AKA \\\"An Old Raincoat Would Never Let You Down\\\") with Ron Wood, Mickey Waller, Martin Quittenton and Keith Emerson. After \\\"Reflections\\\", Quittenton and Rushton both quit the band to be replaced by Mick Bradley (drums) and Steve Joliffe (sax, flute), who gave a jazzy influence to the band in their second album, \\\"Mk. II\\\" (1969). Shortly after this release, Joliffe left the band, which continued as a 4 piece in their third album \\\"Mountains\\\" (1970), which was a returning to the blues-rock of the first album. After a major turnover, Pugh and Bradley invited Louis Cennamo (bass) and, along with special guest Garth Watt-Roy (vocals), recorded \\\"Speech\\\" in 1971. This last album was released posthumously, after Bradley's death in 1972. - Now, exactly 50 years after the release of \\\"Speech\\\" and 53 years after Pugh and Sears collaborated on the band's first LP, Steamhammer will release a new album, \\\"Wailing Again\\\".

Including a previously unreleased recording with Luke 'Long Gone' Miles. Compiled by producer and harmonica player Bob Corritore, who also wrote the liner notes. Carefully remastered by Tom Meyer and pressed by Optimal media, 180-gram edition in a gatefold sleeve, limited to 1.000 copies After some tough early years in which he managed to stay afloat with mostly poorly paid gigs in small clubs and only occasionally came out of Los Angeles or Southern California, William Clarke (March 21, 1951 - November 2, 1996) signed with the famous Alligator Records label. With his debut album 'Blowin' Like Hell' for the Chicago blues factory, the West Coast's blues secret became an endlessly touring international star of the scene! With 'Heavy Hittin' West Coast Harp' we pay tribute and respect to one of the greatest harmonica stylists. As an instrumentalist William Clarke was strongly influenced by George 'Harmonica' Smith, a Chicago contemporary of Little Walter and Walter Horton. Smith came to Los Angeles for a recording session in 1956 and settled on the West Coast. Similar to his iconic idol Smith, from whom he learned a lot of tricks in countless joint appearances, Clarke was equally at home on the cross harmonica as on the chromatic. The combination of Chicago-style harmonica and the cool groove and swing of West Coast blues and jazz met the open ears of blues fans all over the world. On his first album 'Hittin' Heavy' he is accompanied by Hollywood Fats on guitar, later recording sessions include Ronnie Earl, Junior Watson, Rick Holmstrom and Alex Schultz a.m.o.

On his latest album, The Sun is Shining Down, out January 28th via Forty Below Records, Blues legend John Mayall teams up with a stellar cast to deliver a funky soulful affair punctuated by brass, violins, harmonica and electric ukulele. Special guests include, The Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell, fast rising roots rocker Marcus King, Americana icon Buddy Miller, Scarlet Rivera of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review, Chicago blues guitar mainstay Melvin Taylor and Hawaiian ukulele star Jake Shimabukuro. Also on hand are Mayall's longtime dynamic Chicago rhythm section of Greg Rzab on bass guitar and Jay Davenport on drums with Austin's multi-talented and charismatic Carolyn Wonderland on guitar. Recorded at Robby Krieger's (The Doors) Horse Latitudes studio with Grammy nominated Producer Eric Corne, The Sun is Shining Down is Mayall's 5th studio album for Forty Below Records, a fruitful partnership that began with 2014's A Special Life. \\\"I couldn't be happier with the new record,\\\" exclaims Mayall. \\\"I can't wait to share it with my fans. Each one of these special guests brings something unique to the album and our team works so well together. I think you can hear that chemistry in the music,\\\" raves Mayall. The album explores a range of styles and eclectic instruments. Scarlet Rivera's violin beautifully compliments two Mayall originals, the timely \\\"Got to Find a Better Way\\\" and a spirited reboot of the Mayall classic \\\"Deep Blue Sea\\\". Mike Campbell sounds like a natural born Bluesbreaker on the funky Bernard Allison cut \\\"Chills and Thrills\\\" and Marcus King sizzles throughout the soulful \\\"Can't Take No More,\\\" another Mayall original. Buddy Miller's baritone tremolo guitar adds a unique and memorable flair to the Bobby Rush composition \\\"I'm as Good as Gone\\\", while Jake Shimabukuro's electric ukulele is nothing short of astonishing on \\\"One Special Lady\\\". Melvin Taylor proves why he's been wowing Chicago blues audiences for decades on \\\"Hungry and Ready\\\" and \\\"Driving Wheel\\\" and Carolyn Wonderland brilliantly concludes the record with a sensitive moving performance on the title track. As significant as each of these guest turns is, however, they can't overshadow Mayall's own spirited vocals, iconic harmonica and lyrical keyboard work on The Sun is Shining Down. \\\"John shines throughout this album, exuding a joy and gratitude that are infectious.

The concept of the jug band may be considered a novelty by modern standards, but they were highly successful during the 1920s and 30s, and a reliable source of classic country blues recordings. Of them all, no jug band was more successful than the Memphis Jug Band, helmed by veteran bluesman Will Shade, and featuring a rotating lineup of musicians, which at various points included fellow blues legends such as Furry Lewis, Casey Bill Weldon, and Memphis Minnie. What further set Memphis Jug Band apart from other jug bands of the era was the strong influence they took from contemporary jazz music. Their recordings frequently took cues and drew inspiration from contemporary works from Charlie Pierce or Cab Calloway, and twisted them into a distinctly Appalachian sound, inflected with fiddles, washboard, kazoo, and Shade's own adeptness with the jug. Many of their songs, which found release across esteemed blues labels like Victor, Okeh, and Champion-Gennett, would go on to become staples of the jug band genre, and standards of country blues. Memphis Jug Band captures the band at their peak from 1927 to 1934, across 28 songs, spanning two records. The compilation features many of the group's best known classic recordings, such as \\\"Cocaine Habit Blues\\\", \\\"On The Road Again\\\", and \\\"Stealin' Stealin'\\\", perhaps their best known track, notably covered by The Grateful Dead as their first single release.

The album delivers super tasty, dirty guitars, serpentine psychedelic grooves, and propulsive drumming with gleeful abandon.

Bassist Brian Markham and drummer Adam Bulgasem\\u2019s foundations play with time, galloping forward or stretching out into the cosmos. Wished Eye is an expression of the sheer joy of making music together. Delivered with greater confidence and exuberance than ever before, Wished Eye captures the force of a Dommengang show and their explorative nature \\u2014 from euphoria to transcendence. Where previous Dommengang albums evoked a restlessness and a yearning for the open road, Wished Eye takes you on that journey with a seasoned band that has found the key to traveling without ever leaving home. Wished Eye is the studio album of a band that, live, ignites chaotic release and otherworldly meditation. To capture this energy and freedom in the studio, the trio tracked all the songs together to tape and let experimentation run wild. This journey of exploration was indeed linked to all members relocating to Portland, Oregon, finding a new home for their ideas to flourish. Markham explains: \\u201cWe jammed several times a week for two years, at times with no real goal but to play music and make noise together. Lots of nights were followed by backyard hangs around the fire.\\u201d Sig elaborates: \\u201cWe went into rehearsal with no expectations other than to let every idea breathe and let it go as long as needed.\\u201d Working without time constraints or limitations, they could dig deeper than ever into their shared experiences. 1.

{"id": "SugarayRayfordnArtist_SomebodySaveMe", "album_title": "\"Somebody Save Me\"", "artist": "\"Sugaray Rayford \\n(Artist)\"", "description": "\"Somebody Save Me is an ambitious album that slides gracefully between the new blues of Gary Clarke Jr. and Fantastic Negrito, the rock & soul stylings of The War & Treaty and the vintage Daptones soul of the late Charles Bradley and Sharon Jones, bringing a fresh take to classic sounds. The album was written and produced by Forty Below Records founder Eric Corne. Best known for his work with blues legends John Mayall and Walter Trout, Corne and Forty Below have also launched the careers of several talented new artists, such as Sam Morrow, Jaime Wyatt and KaiL Baxley. A number of mainstays from Corne productions feature strongly here including guitarist Rick Holmstrom (Mavis Staples), bassist Taras Prodaniuk (Dwight Yoakam), drummer Matt Tecu (Jakob Dylan), keyboardist Sasha Smith (Sam Beam, Jesca Hoop), guitarist Eamon Ryland (The Happy Mondays) and the horn section from Late Night with Conan O Brien. Corne recorded the bulk of the record live and the chemistry of the performances infuses the songs with a spontaneity and raw emotion. The ten songs on the album explore contrasting themes of darkness and light. There is social commentary like on Time to Get Movin The mansions on the hillside / Look down on homeless camps / While we re caught in the crossfire / Lookin for the exit ramps . There are several love songs, including two gorgeous soul ballads, My Cards are on the Table and Somebody Save Me , the Stax inspired You and I and the more Motown leaning Is It Just Me , She could bring peace to the Middle East / They d be ready to sign / Free the worst villain / From the tightest prison / And have the warden waving goodbye . The album is full of inspired arrangements with several unexpected twists and turns; like the John Barry (James Bond) inspired bridge of Angels and Devils ; the wobbly 1950s inspired keyboard solo and lush strings of the title track, recorded with The Section Quartet (Ryan Adams, Father John Misty); and the gospel choir, shape-shifting keyboards and dramatic horns of The Revelator which seamlessly blends blues, soul and jazz with a hint of reggae. But at the center if it all is Sugaray Rayford s commanding voice, tying it all together.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611qTGnbTHL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.11 x 12.27 x 0.2 inches; 8.32 ounces", "manufacturer": "Forty Below", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2019", "availability": "December 11, 2018", "label": "Forty Below", "asin": "B07KLPTWTS", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Guy Davis explains the concept of the recording, \\\"Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry were two musicians whose work will not be surpassed, let alone improved on. This musical opus, was produced by Fabrizio Poggi. It features our combined musical talents, and is not meant to compete with the originals. It's meant to be a love letter to Brownie and Sonny signed by the both of us.

It is these recordings that make up the Legendary Peg Leg Howell record originally on Testament. But Peg Leg was actually part of the original wave of Blues recording artists, recording for Columbia in 1926. His story is like many: when success proved elusive, he turned his back on music and settled for bootlegging and other types of work until rediscovered in the '60s. By then, he was old and fragile. Qualities that translate beautifully on this quiet, haunting record that would be the bookend to a recording output that was tragically small but truly rich.

He is believed to have been the first to begin amplifying his instrument around the end of the 1930s, and he developed a lead guitar style, sound and technique which reverberates across the rock landscape decades later. Luminaries such as B.B King cite him as a primary influence, and legends of later years - Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan and many others - take part of their inspiration at least directly or indirectly from Walker and his work. Being a prolific recording artist, this collection celebrates Walker's individuality by homing in on his best-selling, most popular and influential tunes from this career defining decade including T-Bone Blues, Bobby Sox Blues, Call It Stormy Monday, Description Blues and Strollin' With Bones.

{"id": "TonyHolidaynArtist_MotelMississippi", "album_title": "\"Motel Mississippi\"", "artist": "\"Tony Holiday \\n(Artist)\"", "description": "\"There's something about Tony Holiday that draws people together. In fact, community has been at the core of Holiday's young career from the beginning. Since relocating from Salt Lake City to Memphis in 2017, Holiday has been at the center of a soul blues revival in Memphis, anchored by a contingent of young, savvy well-schooled musicians with a \\\"family-like\\\" attitude and a strong belief in one another. Mentored by past legends, Holiday and this loose Memphis collective are building on the city's rich traditions and carrying them forward. Motel Mississippi, Holiday's 2nd solo album, was recorded about an hour outside Memphis in Coldwater, Mississippi, at Zebra Ranch, the studio of the late great Memphis legend Jim Dickinson (The Rolling Stones, Big Star). Combining the sounds of North Mississippi Hill Country, Delta Blues, and Memphis soul, Motel Mississippi is equal parts hypnotic blues, driving soul, and juke joint stomper. The album consists of six originals and two covers, \\\"Rob & Steal\\\" by Paul Wine Jones and \\\"Nobody But You\\\" by Asie Payton. Like with previous projects, Motel Mississippi began as a collaborative effort, this time between Holiday, guitarist/songwriter A.J. Fullerton and guitarist/producer Dave Gross who shared production duties with Fullerton. Rich sonic layers provide a forward-thinking quality to these productions, conjuring up a vibe that's modern and retro at the same time. The drone and drive of songs like \\\"Rob & Steal\\\" and \\\"Get By\\\" contrast with juke joint grooves like \\\"Just As Gone\\\" while diving into new territory with the Cajun-infused double harmonica instrumental \\\"Yazoo River.\\\" The album was recorded by another mainstay of recent Memphis recording, Kevin Houston (Southern Avenue, North Mississippi Allstars, G. Love). Other musicians on the album include Lee Williams Jr. On drums, Terrance Grayson on Bass, Aubrey McCrady on guitar, Jake Friel on Harmonica, and Mikey Junior on backup vocals. Motel Mississippi follows 2020's Soul Service, produced by another regular collaborator, Southern Avenue's Ori Naftaly. This followed two volumes of Tony Holiday's Porch Sessions, which saw Holiday traveling across the United States and throughout Europe recording blues musicians on their very own front porches, in front of juke joints, in the countryside, and even on the front stoops of raucous night spots in bustling cities, resulting in two critically acclaimed albums. The guestlist struck a balance between older legends like Grammy\\u00ae winners Charlie Musselwhite and Bobby Rush, former Muddy Waters guitarist John Primer and the iconic Lurie Bell, alongside some of Holiday's peers Southern Avenue, Victor Wainwright, and John N\\u00e9meth. The latter two have served as important mentors for Holiday since his move to Memphis.There's something in the water in Memphis, and Tony Holiday has tapped into it to contribute to an exciting new chapter unfolding in this storied region.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91HtTeZ9obL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "RegionalBlues", "DeltaBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Rob and Steal"}, {"Track 2": "Get By"}, {"Track 3": "Trouble"}, {"Track 4": "She's So Cold"}, {"Track 5": "Just As Gone"}, {"Track 6": "Nobody But You"}, {"Track 7": "You Know Who I Am"}, {"Track 8": "Yazoo River"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.18 x 12.41 x 12.38 inches; 7.52 ounces", "manufacturer": "Forty Below", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "February 1, 2023", "label": "Forty Below", "asin": "B0BTMP25KP", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

La Botz learned from pre-war blues masters such as David Honeyboy Edwards and Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis, but Sunnyside makes a sonic move well beyond string blues. Sunnyside was produced by Jimmy Sutton at Hi-Style Studios in Chicago, whose previous production work includes albums for JD McPherson and Pokey LaFarge. The rock 'n roll groove is paramount throughout, propelled by driving bass and drums, ethereal piano, and doo-wop inspired gang vocals.

{"id": "VanjaSky_Reborn", "album_title": "\"Reborn\"", "artist": "\"Vanja Sky\"", "description": "\"Vanja Sky is Croatia's answer to Sheryl Crow and Norah Jones. An artistic career couldn't develop much faster. Five years after learning to play the guitar, Vanja recorded her debut album with renowned artists from the international blues scene. Quickly, a highly successful follow-up work titled Woman Named Trouble was released. Now it's time for the release of her third album, reborn, on the Kick The Flame label and distributed by Broken Silence. While the blues was originally the spark for the young pastry chef, she has since embraced rock without neglecting her blues roots. The album represents a significant evolution of her own musical personality. The title reborn signifies a fresh start, a rebirth, a new beginning. As such, the album features two images of Vanja Sky, one from her childhood and another current photograph. Among the ten songs, there are eight newly written songs and two cover versions of legendary rock titles, featuring special guests who are members of the respective original bands. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the song I'd Love To Change The World, Vanja spontaneously invited Ric Lee, drummer, Woodstock legend, and founding member of Ten Years After, to the studio to re-record the track with him. Continuing her tribute to Rory Gallagher, which has become a tradition, Vanja includes another song on reborn. In the new recording of I Take What I Want, none other than Garry McAvoy takes on the bass part. He played alongside Rory Gallagher for over 20 years. Another highlight of the new album is a duet with Carl Sentance, the current singer of arguably the most successful Scottish hard rock band, Nazareth, and the vocalist for Deep Purple keyboardist Don Airey's solo project. The title M\\u00fcha refers to the transience of life and the appreciation we should develop for what we have here and now. The inspiration for the new song came from the unexpected death of a colleague close to Vanja in the music scene.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619s8EiW7XL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "0.11 x 12.3 x 12.21 inches; 9.76 ounces", "manufacturer": "Kick The Flame", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2023", "availability": "June 16, 2023", "label": "Kick The Flame", "asin": "B0C6Z1QLHH", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

Is sure to mark the global explosion of a singer-songwriter who's long been threatening to go 'boom'.Coming up the old-fashioned way - with a thousand word-of-mouth shows blazing her reputation across the planet - Shay's first decade has seen four wins at the San Diego Music Awards, a nomination at last year's prestigious Blues Music Awards and the tag of \\\"future blues icon\\\" bestowed by Blues Matters! #magazine. Whether you picked up 2012's debut album, Soul Tonic, caught up with her on 2018's acclaimed A Woman Rules The World - or heard her songs on major TV networks including HBO and NBC - you're probably already a fan, whether you realise it or not. But having signed to Ruf last year, Shay is set to paint the world red in 2020.Tracking at Austin's Wire Recording Studio with producer Kaz Kazanoff, Stand Up! #saw the singer let the good vibes flow. Setting the pace with the title track's brassy soul and smoky quickfire vocal, this new record's upbeat moments twist from the rolling groove of Tell The Truth to the dirtied-up funk of P.S.

Bernard Fowler's talents as a singer, songwriter, producer, and instrumentalist have resonated throughout the span of his extraordinary career in the music industry. However, Bernard is most widely known as the longtime collaborator and backing vocalist for the Rolling Stones, a position he has proudly held for thirty-one years and counting. His dynamic vocals have also appeared on hundreds of albums for other artists as diverse as Herbie Hancock, Yoko Ono, Alice Cooper, and Bootsy Collins. Fowler's newest solo endeavor, Inside Out is a brilliant re-interpretation of songs from the Rolling Stones catalogue, recasting them in a mode often reminiscent of the pre-hip-hop work of the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron. In the process, Fowler forges a new, very personal identity for songs he's performed for decades alongside the \\\"the world's greatest rock n' roll band.\\\" The first single from Inside Out is a conga-driven re-make of \\\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\\" but generally the album dives into Rolling Stones deep cuts.

{"id": "DavieAllan_InAHeavyBag", "album_title": "\"In A Heavy Bag\"", "artist": "\"Davie Allan\"", "description": "\"What\\u2019s in a name? In Lowell Fulson\\u2019s case, plenty! During his long and storied career he recorded under his own name as well as Lowell Fullsom and Lowell Fulsom. Done so for business reasons, there was no hiding his true identity once he began to sing and play. An Oklahoma native, Fulson grew up with equal doses of Bob Wills and Texas blues and soon became the leading proponent of the West Coast blues sound. A triple threat as a singer/writer/guitar player, Fulson recorded for many labels, notably Swing Time, Chess/Checker, Kent and Rounder. His numerous hits included \\u201cReconsider Baby,\\u201d \\u201cLonesome Christmas,\\u201d \\u201cTramp\\u201d (famously covered by Carla and Rufus Thomas), \\u201cThree O\\u2019Clock Blues\\u201d and \\u201cEveryday I Have The Blues.\\u201d His influence on his peers and subsequent generations of musicians is incalculable.Upon signing with Chess Records in 1954, Fulson recorded \\u201cReconsider Baby\\u201d under the direction of Stan Lewis in Dallas, Texas. One of the horn players on the session, saxophonist David \\u201cFathead\\u201d Newman, became a major star in his own right. Though the hits temporarily dried up in the latter part of his Chess/Checker career, a move to Kent Records in 1965 sparked a chart resurgence. Hitting in rapid succession with \\u201cBlack Nights,\\u201d \\u201cTramp,\\u201d \\u201cMake a Little Love\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m a Drifter,\\u201d Fulson firmly reestablished his dominance of the genre, winning over a new generation of fans coming to the blues through the Rolling Stones, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Cream and other blues rock acolytes. Taking a break from Kent, Fulson reunited with Lewis to record a new album, In A Heavy Bag, as \\u201cLowell Fulsom.\\u201d Released on Lewis\\u2019 Shreveport, Louisiana-based Jewel Records, it is heavy, indeed! Album opener \\u201cLook at You Baby\\u201d throws out sharp, piercing leads that would make Albert Collins shudder. Right on its heels is a wickedly salacious cover of the Beatles \\u201cWhy Don\\u2019t We Do It In The Road.\\u201d The guitar tones on \\u201cDon\\u2019t Destroy Me\\u201d percolate with such deep distortion that it surely shook Jimmy Page all night long and then some. Yet, throughout the album, the most powerful instrument is Fulson\\u2019s booming voice. Singing in a muscular, direct tone, it is easy to hear the effect he had on his one-time piano player, Mr. Ray Charles Robinson, aka Ray Charles. Fulson continued to perform and record until illness slowed him shortly before his death in 1999. Across such a rich career, there are many defining moments and In A Heavy Bag gathers eleven of those moments in one place. Sourced from the original Jewel analog tapes, this album is an immensely enjoyable listening experience from beginning to end.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lds2CST1L._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Rock", "Oldies&Retro", "SurfRock"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Look at You Baby"}, {"Track 2": "Why Don't We Do It in the Road"}, {"Track 3": "Sleeper"}, {"Track 4": "Lady in the Rain"}, {"Track 5": "My Baby"}, {"Track 6": "Man on the Run"}, {"Track 7": "Don't Destroy Me"}, {"Track 8": "This Feeling"}, {"Track 9": "Trouble Everywhere"}, {"Track 10": "Cheating Woman"}, {"Track 11": "Man of Motion"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.5 x 12.5 x 0.13 inches; 8.47 ounces", "manufacturer": "Sundazed Music, Inc.", "model_number": "SLP5207", "release_date": "2014", "availability": "February 12, 2007", "label": "Sundazed Music, Inc.", "asin": "B0007WFYHU", "country_origin": "USA", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "No", "run_time": ""}

Bearing songs of soul searching, of spiritual uplift, of tunes to groove to. Equipped with a powerful voice and stinging guitar the troubadour lays down his marker and backs up the statement. Two Times UK Blues Award winner Mississippi Macdonald has it all to play that troubadour as he presents his third album on APM Records. The gravelly Gospel tones on If I Could Only Hear My Mother Pray Again, and the imploring emotion on Your Dreams have MacDonald stretching out vocally. The former song in turn also showcasing another tour de force from regular backing vocalist Lucy Randall. Two self-penned instrumentals pay tribute; 3.35am, to one of MacDonald's prime influences Freddie King, and Soul City One to the in-house studio sound of Stax / MacDonald continues to be an excellent interpreter of southern soul and two more songs from the stable of Memphis studio and publishing house Ecko in Hard Luck and Trouble and the title track prove this. So too the band's take on the R&B classic We're Gonna Make It which in MacDonald's hands really swings. Sinking is an epic ballad in which to lose yourself completely. The album is rich in variety, vibe and soulful energy. It's MacDonald's Blues and a whole lot more. MacDonald is a guest artist with the 'Take Me To The River All Stars', performing on stage at Red Rooster, filmed in session with Eric Gales and Jools Holland, and is filmed again at Royal Studios in Memphis on October 1st. MacDonald and band will perform at the UK Blues Challenge on October 8th, MacDonald is special guest of Visit Mississippi in Liverpool on October 18th when they unveil the first ever Blues Trail marker outside The Cavern. MacDonald will perform with Clarksdale veteran Super Chikan. International PR agent Blind Raccoon has been engaged to promote the new album. Last album 'Heavy State Loving Blues' was no. 1 on Roots Music Radio Contemporary Blues, no.1 on the IBBA chart for albums of the year 2023, and top 50 on the US Apple iTunes Blues chart, plus plays and a session on BBC Radio 2 Blues Show (Cerys Mathews). Live shows running up to end of March 2025. A singer/ songwriter from London who speaks quietly but makes music with real gravitas. A rising star since winning Traditional Blues Artist Of The Year and Acoustic Act of the Year at the 2024 UK Blues Awards. MacDonald has released two previous albums on APM Records. 'Heavy State Loving Blues' in 2023, and 'Do Right Say Right' in 2021- selected as a top 10 Blues album of the year in MOJO.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FyvdQb9PL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "I Got What You Need"}, {"Track 2": "We're Gonna Make It"}, {"Track 3": "Stop!

He also made a name for himself opening for such beat greats as The Lords, The Rattles and The Liverbirds. A call-up to the German army led to the disbandment of the Stares. At the beginning of 1969, J\\u00fcrgen Boss played with the band Fellows from Esslingen am Neckar and, from 1971, with Fate from Kirchheim/Teck. From 1972 to 1974, he was a member of the Stuttgart-based band Parchman Farm, and in 1973 he also performed with Stoned War and Mammut, both also from Stuttgart. The J. Boss Blues Band was formed in 1974. This was followed by concerts all over Germany, mainly in jazz clubs, with a variety of formations. It was during this period that he performed as a backing band for Errol Dixon, Eddie Taylor & Louis Meyers, Jim Kahr (ex John Lee Hooker Band) and Judy Cheeks. J Boss also appeared on stage as a duo with Henry Cray, pianist to blues legend Sonny Boy Williamson II. In 1983, the band was renamed the J. Boss Band, as its musical orientation shifted away from blues and towards rock/hard rock. In 1984, the band opened for Eric Burdon and the Puhdys, and toured Germany with Dr Feelgood. In 1986, J. Boss composed and played the soundtrack to Olaf Zierl's film \\\"Unter weitem Himmel\\\". In 1993, further shows followed, opening for Rory Gallagher, Saxon and Nine Bellow Zero, followed by a tour of France. In the '90s, after another album and a single, his trail was lost. The hitherto underrated \\\"Tokyo Fever\\\" album is now released for the first time on CD and also on vinyl.

First of all a man of creativity: pictures and words (I've also written German poems. But most of them were nothing. I'm better with English!) are his m\\u00e9tiers. And of course music. Music was already there at the very beginning, he says: When I was four years old, I stood at home with my mother's knitting needles and conducted to the music on the radio, he says with a grin. But nobody's allowed to tell anyone about that anymore. Bob Dylan came into his life at puberty. Then there came Woodstock, David Crosby and Stephen Stills. 'Easy Rider' made a big impression on him. Later, Chris Whitley. I'm quite an all-natural guy, the singer, guitarist and composer says about himself. He doesn't have a computer at home. But he does have the forest right on his doorstep, his sheltered adventure. And the music? It has a somnambulistic beauty and clarity. Interwoven with the blues. And yet completely individual. Full of space. And full of depth. Marte's characterful rasping voice and his flowing folk and blues pickings on the guitar are the constants here.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Hm-ymKPtL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [], "language": "English", "dimensions": "", "manufacturer": "Crosscut Records", "model_number": "", "release_date": "", "availability": "May 2, 2023", "label": "Crosscut Records", "asin": "B0C4Q4QSW4", "country_origin": "Germany", "disc_count": "2", "discontinued": "", "run_time": "33 minutes"}

To achieve such an outcome, More Boss Black Rockers Vol. 1: Guitar Pickin' Fool continues it's exploration of Black African American rock 'n' roll by mining deep into the heart of a traditional rhythm and blues scene of 50's America that eventually became rock 'n' roll, and where you will hear established artists rubbing shoulders with the obscure. This is merely one segment of the attraction here, because the sounds blaring from the adjacent speakers is often wild in nature, raw and dangerous, just as it is scintillating, not to mention unhinged rock 'n' roll. Let's face it, it's the kinds of sounds that no doubt left many a jaw gaping as rock 'n' roll was ushered into the world for the very first time upon an innocent public, before evolving into the next big thing and continuing to resonate in the present with an equally feisty presence. Quick, to the tracks! Perusing the lengthy list of rock 'n' roll contenders from the setlist of More Boss Black Rockers Vol. 1: Guitar Pickin' Fool, any attempt to arrive at a favourite makes for an impossible task because, quite simply, there's not a dud in the house. Such realisation dawns once the opening bars of 'Chicken, Baby, Chicken' opens fire with the vocals of Tony Harris enough to propel this glorious track on it's own! Such charisma continues via the appropriately named 'Rock And Roll Is In My Soul' from Chuck Grey, to enjoying a moment under the halo of rock 'n' roll with plenty of brass and full band approach of Sammy Taylor and 'Switchin' In The Kitchen'. The intensity of rock 'n' roll continues via more knockout vocals from, this time, H-Bomb Ferguson during 'Mary Little Mary', to an altogether different approach of 'Goin' Goin' Gone' by vocal group The Jewels who warrant further investigation.

The LPs come with printed inner sleeves, and as an extra bonus a poster on top. The recording and mastering quality meets even the highest audiophile demands. With this special edition, Meyer Records honors the work of an absolute original, a great storyteller and blues musician who - coming from Belgium - is at home all over the world and whose most original blues speaks a global language. You don't have to know the guy, you don't have to know where he comes from or with whom he has played, what he looks like, whether he is a legend or a blank sheet of paper - what you hear immediately is that he has the blues. And that is something like that! But a glance at the album covers makes the picture perfect: Only someone who has lived a life away from convention for decades has such a mug: a Berber, a tramp, a traveling musician. And Roland Van Campenhout is just such a person. The Belgian has been releasing records and touring the world since 1967. His guitar playing is meditative, his timbre alternates between drunken and ingratiating. Sometimes the man with the curly beard even has something shaman-like about him. Bio Roland Van Campenhout: Roland Van Campenhout is a living legend, archetype for an almost extinct species of artist - that of the sound magician, deeply rooted in blues and folk, yet open to pretty much all genres, whether they are called ethno, jazz or psychedelic. As a teenager - inspired by author Jack Kerouac's beatnik classic 'On The Road' as his philosophy of life - he was part of a skiffle combo. From the end of the 1960s, the man with the Catweazle beard turned increasingly to the blues, played for a while in Rory Gallagher's band, and from 2000 onwards there were collaborations with the much younger Belgian crossover artists such as Sioen.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M5o4xsaeL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues", "ContemporaryBlues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Black Girl (In the Pines)"}, {"Track 2": "Going Down Slow"}, {"Track 3": "The Truth"}, {"Track 4": "There's a Man Goin' 'Round Takin' Names"}, {"Track 5": "Eyesight to the Blind"}, {"Track 6": "Officer Kiss Me Please"}, {"Track 7": "Blue Azul"}, {"Track 8": "Kosher Karma Sutra"}, {"Track 9": "Footsteps Fall"}, {"Track 10": "Jelly Roll Baker"}, {"Track 11": "Never Too Soon"}, {"Track 12": "Last Letter Home"}, {"Track 13": "Little Ladie"}, {"Track 14": "900 Miles"}, {"Track 15": "Two Old Mules"}, {"Track 16": "Way Beyond the Moon"}, {"Track 17": "Fine Sugar Mamma"}, {"Track 18": "Frankie & Johnny"}, {"Track 19": "Don't Tell Me Lies"}]}], "language": "English", "dimensions": "12.2 x 12.2 x 0.2 inches; 2.21 Pounds", "manufacturer": "Meyer Records", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2020", "availability": "October 12, 2020", "label": "Meyer Records", "asin": "B08KWV8YWY", "country_origin": "Germany", "disc_count": "3", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}

It is worth mentioning that Breezy's nine-year tenure as a guitarist in the band of Chicago's illustrious Linsey Alexander definitely gave him the experience and confidence to develop his own musical identity. I became acutely aware of his musical growth and development when I collaborated with him on his previous Delmark release, Sometimes The Blues Got Me (Delmark DE 853).

{"id": "ALDERTONPETEnArtist_SomethingSmooth", "album_title": "\"Something Smooth\"", "artist": "\"ALDERTON,PETE \\n(Artist)\"", "description": "\"My whole life has been a story. It's too long to tell so here is a tip: listen to the songs. Since his 2006 breakthrough, Living On Love, everyone refers to Pete Alderton as the blues man from Paderborn. With his new album, Something Smooth, the Anglo-American singer, guitar player and songwriter proves that it's about time to discover a new Pete Alderton: the storyteller. In contrast to other great musical storytellers such as Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen who chose Folk or Chanson as a vehicle for their lyrics, Pete Alderton stays deeply rooted in the Blues. Seven minute songs full of details and references are not for him, he rather picks out moments, episodes, feelings and moods. This way he builds up a story song by song over the length of an album. His story. As one can guess from the album title there is a smooth and relaxed vibe on Something Smooth. Like in the romantic title track, in Man On The Run or in Never, a jazzy piano ballad. These original compositions are accompanied by touching versions of Bob Marley's Redemption Song and I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You by Tom Waits. But don't be fooled, Something Smooth is not Pete Aldertons bedroom album. the man is way too versatile and edgy for that. Right at the beginning of the album he shows with Revelation Blues by blues legend Robert Johnson that his heart still belongs to the rough Delta-Blues. So Cool is a perfect Chicago style blues song just like Down To The River captures that iconic highway feeling. The reduced arrangements with acoustic guitar, interspersed with piano and electric guitar, bass, as well as some drums, mandolin and blues harp every now and then, add to the picture. As always, Pete Aldertons voice sits in the mix full of character and confidence. From the first line it draws the listener into the stories and into the song. With all of that Something Smooth reminds one of a good book: once you started you want to know what happens next.\"", "amazon_image_url": "\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dNmxFZ2XL._SX522_.jpg\"", "category": ["CDs&Vinyl", "Blues"], "disc_tracks": [{"Disc 1": [{"Track 1": "Something Smooth"}, {"Track 2": "Revelation Blues"}, {"Track 3": "So Cool"}, {"Track 4": "Malted Milk"}, {"Track 5": "Man on the Run"}]}, {"Disc 2": [{"Track 1": "Down to the River"}, {"Track 2": "Making Hay"}, {"Track 3": "Love Blues"}, {"Track 4": "I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You"}, {"Track 5": "Trouble"}, {"Track 6": "Redemption Song"}]}], "language": "", "dimensions": "12 x 12.6 x 1 inches; 8 ounces", "manufacturer": "Songways", "model_number": "", "release_date": "2017", "availability": "August 16, 2016", "label": "Songways", "asin": "B01KBGTHB0", "country_origin": "", "disc_count": "1", "discontinued": "", "run_time": ""}
